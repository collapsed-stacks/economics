There has been quite a bit of speculation as to what effect the Quantitative Easing would have.  Have there been any studies that examine the actual results?

<p>Here is a very recent <a href="http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/users/webfac/cromer/e210c_f11/Lecture%209%20Slides.pdf" rel="nofollow">powerpoint</a> from Berkley on this topic, with a mix of empirical and quantitative approaches.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/7192" rel="nofollow">The economic impact of QE: Lessons from the UK</a>, Joyce. Tong &amp; Woods studied the impacts from the <strong>first</strong> round of Quantitative Easing in the UK.</p>

<p>They state that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there were significant falls in medium- to long-term gilt yields after important QE announcements, summing to just under 100 basis points</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and their modelled estimates are of an increase in GDP of 1.5%-2%, and an increase to the CPI of 0.75-1.5 percentage points.</p>

Paul Krugman says that quantitative easing was a disappointment, because it did not directly address the fact that the US economy has suffered from low demand. Links in his blog post below:
