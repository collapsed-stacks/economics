For PCs, I think the clear winner is Notepad++. It has support for syntax highlighting (so commands, variable names, etc. show up in different colors.

However, I also use a mac and generally find myself using a default text editor for lack of better options. I imagine that emacs or vim *could* be configured for this to work on a mac, but I find those programs too cumbersome.

<p><a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/" rel="nofollow">Gedit</a>, a very nice notepad that can run on MAC and has optional syntax highlighting for STATA (<a href="http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=55704" rel="nofollow">second post here</a>)</p>
