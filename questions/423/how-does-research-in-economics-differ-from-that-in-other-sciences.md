When I think of Chemistry research, I imagine test tubes and a lot of reactions. When I think of English Literature research, I imagine someone going through a manuscript from the 13th century looking at the margins with notes written by the original author looking for hints on how they connect to history.

In general, I perceive research as something like that - perhaps it stems from my childhood notion that "research" meant "looking for new dinosaur fossils" But anyways, I don't seem to understand economics research. How does one do this? What is one looking for? 

In summary: how does applied/empirical research in economics differ from applied research in other sciences?"

<p>There is actually an incredibly friendly community of people who are asking (and answering) this question over at the TestMagic forums, in the <a href="http://www.urch.com/forums/phd-economics/" rel="nofollow">"PhD in Economics" forum</a>. This is basically a place full of people thinking about what they want to do -- PhD in Economics, Masters, any degree in something related. A topic of conversation that has been covered quite a bit, I'm sure, is "what economics research is about." If you're ever thinking about possibly going the PhD route, that is an astonishing social resource. </p>

<p>If your question could be restated, "what do economic researchers do?" then I have two fantastic book recommendations for you:
<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0472066854" rel="nofollow">Passion and Craft: Economists at Work</a> 
<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0262025620" rel="nofollow">Lives of the Laureates</a></p>

<p>Both talk pretty clearly about what economists <em>do</em> when they do research. Great insights, I think. You can find chapters from the first one on some of the economists websites (each chapter is a different economist telling his/her story, I believe). The second one is a collection of essays by Nobel Laureats, each on the subject "My Evolution as an Economist." It's not a book to be read straight through; I just flipped through it and read random essays from time to time. I thoroughly enjoyed it that way. </p>
