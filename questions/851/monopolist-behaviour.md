For a monopolist, if  

 $C = F+4q+q^2$ 

where $C$ is total cost, $F$ is fixed cost, $p$ is price and $q$ is quantity,

 1. how does the profit maximising price and quantity depend on $F$?
 2. how does the monopolist behave if $F$ sharply increases?

This was added into the question by the OP but should have been an answer:

Monopolists choose output such that $MR$ = $MC$, where $MR$ is marginal revenue and $MC$ is marginal cost.

Fixed costs are never involved. So price and quantity can't change, since the demand curve is not affected. Although, if $F$ is very large, the monopolist may shut down operations.

So a profit maximizing firm will worry about making marginal cost equal marginal revenue. We measure the firm's profit function as
$$P=p(q)q-c(q)$$
The derivative of this gives us $$P'=p(q)+p'(q)q-c'(q)$$
Which we set equal to zero and solve for $q$ in order to maximize profit. Since the firm is a monopoly, we can set $p(q)=p$ since it controls the quantity supplied in the market and $p'(q)=0$. We take the derivative of your cost function then and solve.
$$p-(4+2q)=0$$
Notice that the derivative of $c(q)$ does not include $F$ the fixed cost, since we treated it as a constant. In the end, you get $q*=(p-4)/2$, and we see that the quantity supplied is not dependent on $F$.

If $F$ sharply increases, then the firm may shut down depending on whether the fixed costs are sunk. A sunk cost is a fixed cost that cannot be recuperated by shutting down, so if $F$ is sunk, then the firm's behavior will not change.
