Suppose we have the following system of equations:  

$Q_s=-20+3P$  
$Q_d=-220-5P$  
$Q_s=Q_d$   
  
Say we want to find the tax burden of the consumer, the tax burden of the firm, and the total revenue generated for the government for some excise tax *t*.
  
Do we do this by looking at the elasticity of each the supplier and consumer?  
  
The Elasticity of *Q* with respect to *P* can be calculated by:  

$\eta_Q,_P = P/Q*dQ/dP$  
  
With this we see that the elasticity of supply is 3 and the elasticity of demand is -5
  
Can we use these to find the tax burden?  And how do we calculate the government tax revenue in terms of *t* for the government?
