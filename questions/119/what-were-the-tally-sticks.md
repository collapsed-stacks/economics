What are the tally sticks, and how come they worked for the economy? I understand that they were a form of currency and were of fix value based on the notches, but how did they work as a currency? Were they used like banknotes and coins are used today - exchanged for one another from the highest to the lowest levels of economy? Can't imagine them being too useful on the small scale due to their size.
