I was doing a lot of research into organized crime in East Asia for a project as a favor to an author-friend of mine, and I noticed that there were noted economists and journalists who, in conjunction, estimate the value of black market operations worldwide. 

What is the methodology for this? How do these numbers come together? Are these numbers captured in traditional market models?
