I am trying to calculate the overhead costs of brick and mortar retail and grocery stores, in the United States

How much do employees cost a year? I am thinking more so of cashiers. They are generally paid from minimum wage to $20/hour, but I dont know how much other overhead costs (such as accounting, breaks, overtime etc) are needed to stay compliant

It will depend  on the local tax regime. In the UK, I typically work to a ratio of 1:1 - that is, that all the overheads - taxes, administration, HR & payroll department, employee liability cover, and so on - are about the same as the direct pay. So an employee costing X per year directly, will cost 2X per year in total.
