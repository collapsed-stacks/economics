What is the mathematical structure or object that represents the concept of money? Is it a real number, a function of time, a functional in a Hilbert space? Or more generally, is it a mapping from X to Y? If so, what are the spaces X and Y?

<p>I'm not sure at all that this is a meaningful question. Why should there be one mathematical structure that represents the <strong>concept</strong> of money? Perhaps there's none. Perhaps there are several, depending on the context.</p>

<p>Here's one way of looking at it. I don't know if this is any use.</p>

<p>Money is a mapping from (X,X,time,space) to the set of rational numbers, where X is the set of saleable goods and services. It indicates at any one place in time and space how much of any one member of X is worth, relative to another.</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<p>f(Brent Crude Oil, WTI Crude Oil,2012-03-06 08:00:00,London spot oil market) $\approx$ 1.1586</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.ft.com/" rel="nofollow">FT.com</a>; prices WTI Crude US\$106.88/b. Brent Crude US\$123.83/b</p>

<p>But that only covers one of the roles of money - acting as a metric for the relative value of good. Money has several roles, and a very blurry definition. Or, to put it another way, it has multiple partially overlapping definitions.</p>
