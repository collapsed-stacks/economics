Since the pathbreaking paper [Stochastic Games][1] (1953) by Shapley, people have analyzed stochastic games and their deterministic counterpart, dynamic games, by examining Markov Perfect Equilibria, equilibria that condition only on the state and are sub-game perfect. Now these games are essentially all games with observable actions. I would like to know if there are analog equilibrium concepts for games with persistent incomplete information. With persistent, I mean that private information is not independent between periods, so that players have to actually learn.

Edit: 

Motivation: I have written a paper on a certain conceptual issue of Markov Perfect Equilibrium (the definition of the state space). Several applied economists have asked me if a similar analysis can be done for MPE in incomplete information games. So I would like to know how the notion is applied in the literature.
