## Why do countries consider it important to pay back foreign debt that came from generations ago?

Is it simply due to some sort of convention, and that due to such convention, all parties understand that it is "okay" for another country to enforce debt collection?

After all - should the citizens of one country be held responsible for imbalances in debt made by their ancestors?

From a question comment...

I'm wondering why countries are so keen on enforcing that rule. Especially given that for the indebted country, is often in its self-interest to find arguments to break that rule

<p>It is very beneficial for a government to be able to borrow against its future income - since projects such as infrastructure and education cost revenue now, and bear rewards in the future. This can be an extremely valuable option for a government, consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased productivity over people's lifetimes if a government invests <em>now</em> in improving  education.</li>
<li>Increased productivity if the government invests <em>now</em> in reducing diseases with damaging long-term effects, such as childhood malnutrition.</li>
<li>Increased trade in the future enabled by building a bridge <em>now</em> to a neighbouring country.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given this, governments want to maintain the <em>ability</em> to raise money by borrowing. Even if they have plenty of money to spend right now, it is a valuable option to be able to borrow in order to invest in the future - so the government wants to keep this option open.</p>

<p>If the government stopped paying back <em>old</em> debt, then why should anyone who might lend it money now, or in the future, trust that it will repay back any new debt?</p>

<p>Without this trust, the advantages of being able to borrow are not available: motivating paying old debt in order to ensure a continued ability to borrow.</p>

<p>Argentina, for example, has been banned from international capital markets <a href="http://www.roubini.com/briefings/57113.php">after defaulting in 2002</a>.</p>
