I am particularly interested in hearing thoughts on what are logical next steps in the research agenda of people who are interested in "The experimental approach to development economics" or in the evaluation of policy.

Many people reject the notion that a randomized controlled trial (RCT) can estimate relevant policy parameters. They generally argue for a more "structural" approach. Is there a good middle-ground and will structuralism begin to take hold?
