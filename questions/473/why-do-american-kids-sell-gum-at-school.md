The title describes the question. ***Why*** do kids sell gum at school ?

If another child wanted to buy gum, and had the money for it, why wouldn't he just go buy it himself ? 

I hardly think gum is a scarce commodity, that too in **america**. I haven't heard/seen this happen elsewhere, and it appears to be a stereotypical *"american thing"*. 
It seems that I'm missing some piece of the socio-economic puzzle, or that this "sterotype" isn't true at all.

Kids sell candy in school so they can have their own spending money. Other kids buy because it  is available when convenient.

In my experience with public schools, there definitely is an economy there, as new sellers can seek to undercut the more established seller's prices.
