Is there evidence-based research in the peer-reviewed literature on the economics of legalising intoxicants that have different statuses in different countries (or across different times)? I'm thinking of **total** welfare, aggregated across:

 - crime; that is to say, crimes other than drug possession and trade
 - law enforcement
 - health care
 - economic productivity
 - balance of trade
 - tax revenues
 - and so on.

<p>Gary Becker has some extensive analysis on this in his various writings. Here's <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2010/12/drug-legalizationposner.html">Gary's comments</a> on a Cato Institute analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A recent monograph published by the libertarian Cato Institute—Jeffrey
  A. Miron and Katherine Waldock, The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug
  Prohibition (2010), available at
  <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/DrugProhibitionWP.pdf--offers">www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/DrugProhibitionWP.pdf</a>--offers an
  estimate of the budgetary cost to the U.S. government (federal, state,
  and local) of the federal and state legal prohibitions against the
  sale and use of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and other mind-altering
  drugs. The lead author, Jeffrey Miron, has an economics Ph.D. from MIT
  and lectures in economics at Harvard; he has published extensively on
  the economics of the drug prohibition. His coauthor is a doctoral
  candidate at NYU’s business school. I will summarize the monograph and
  then offer some thoughts of my own on the question of legalizing the
  illegal drugs. </p>
  
  <p>The authors estimate that legalizing these drugs (which would require
  repealing both federal and state prohibitions) would <strong>reduce government
  expenditures by $41.3 billion per year</strong>, with about two-thirds of the
  savings accruing to state and local government. The savings would
  involve reductions in police expenditures, in prosecutorial and
  judicial expenditures, and in jail and prison expenditures. The
  authors estimate the reductions by multiplying the various expenditure
  categories by the percentage of arrests, prosecutions, and prison
  terms that are attributable to drug offenses. This is a crude method
  of estimation, because different types of criminal offense involve
  different amounts of police, prosecutorial and judicial, and prison
  resources; for example, the length of imprisonment for a particular
  type of offense is the best estimator of the prison costs for that
  offense, and the length varies across types of offense.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to reducing expenditures on law enforcement, <strong>legalizing
  the illegal drugs would, the authors argue, increase tax revenues
  (federal, state, and possibly local as well); they estimate the
  increase at $46.7 billion a year.</strong></p>

<p>The Economist did a superb review of the costs of illegal drugs in 2001. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/706591" rel="nofollow">The feature</a> requires subscription, but I include some notable quotes.</p>

<p>From the editorial, perhaps the most telling comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Illegality also puts a premium on selling strength: if each purchase
  is risky, then it makes sense to buy drugs in concentrated form. In
  the same way, Prohibition in the United States in the 1920s led to a
  fall in beer consumption but a rise in the drinking of hard liquor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if what you're doing is illegal anyway, may as well go for the jugular.  And, no matter how much governments spend on prohibition, the profits are better:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a kilogram of cocaine retails for upwards of \$110,000, the exporter
  can easily afford to double the few hundred dollars paid to the grower
  without much damage to his overall margin. Attempts to persuade
  growers to switch to planting pineapples are equally doomed: the
  cocaine exporters can readily outbid any reasonable scheme.  ...  The
  costs of seizure are small compared with the profits. Earlier this
  year, the US Coastguard seized two vast shipments of cocaine, one of 8
  tonnes and the other of 13 tonnes. Together, they could have supplied
  21m retail sales. To the astonishment of law-enforcement officers, the
  retail price of cocaine did not appear to budge. The enormous street
  value of the product makes it extremely cheap to ship. As Mr Reuter
  puts it, “A pilot who demands \$500,000 for flying a plane with 250
  kilograms is generating costs of only \$2,000 per kilogram—less than 2%
  of the retail price. Even if a \$500,000 plane has to be abandoned
  after one flight, it adds only another \$2,000 to the kilogram price.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On taxing drugs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there is another, more mundane cost that should be taken into
  account: the loss of potential revenue. One of the main reasons
  Prohibition eventually came to an end in America was that it yielded
  no tax revenues. Likewise, prohibition of drugs hands over to
  criminals and rogue states a vast amount of revenue—say \$80
  billion-100 billion a year, based on the gap between rich-world import
  prices and retail prices—that governments could otherwise tax away and
  spend for the common good.</p>
</blockquote>
