The World Economic Forum [Global Competitiveness Report][1] offers a comprehensive view of individual country risk/reward.  There has been an explosion of these types of indexes over the past few years.  

The UN has its [Human Development Index][2], the World Bank has its [Ease of Doing Business][3] report and there are dozens of other organisations producing such analysis and rankings.

Given that there are over 200 country investment destinations and you might want to narrow that list down before conducting in-depth research which reports/indexes or data/comparisons are most useful (health, education, tax rates, employment levels, that sort of thing)?

Please ignore ratings agencies in your answer.  They produce useful scores but their methodology and underlying data is "closed" and proprietary, so difficult to evaluate or adjust to particular needs.  This question is about being able to evaluate the analysis and, potentially, reweight or reorientate the existing index.
