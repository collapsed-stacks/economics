From [Wikipedia:][1]

> A study of international health care spending levels published in the health policy journal Health Affairs in the year 2000 found that the U.S. spends substantially more on health care than any other country in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and that the use of health care services in the U.S. is below the OECD median by most measures. The authors of the study conclude that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. than elsewhere.

What are the economic explanations for the phenomenon of high-cost yet relatively low-performing healthcare in the United States? Is there a large contributing factor of poor policy resulting in perverse incentives? Or?
