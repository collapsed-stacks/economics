Let's see. One marriage term is exorbitant alimony that's proportional to man's wealth. Beatty Chadwick went to jail for 14 years because he refused to pay it. http://freebeattychadwick.blogspot.com/

This will obviously more costly and hence scare off lots of richer males. Poorer males are undeterred because they don't have tons of money anyway. By insisting on getting married women "choice pool" will be smaller with the richest males out of the pool.

Another term is exclusivity. This will be more costly and hence scare off lots of attractive tall handsome charming males. It's easy to grant exclusivity if no one else want you anyway. If you got 10-20 girls wanting to mate with you, then exclusivity becomes far more expensive.

The same can be used when male and female role is reversed though not as well. However males tend to seek the pretty rather than the rich and they tend to aim for quantity rather than quality.

Evolutionary psychology predict that women prefer the rich. In that case, marriage tend to drive out their most desirable target then.

**Note:**

Search google for "do women prefer the rich"

Actually evolutionary psychology go one step further. Women prefer rich men not because of they want the money. The wealth or conspicuous consumption are humans' peacock's tale. http://thegreatdebate.org.uk/sexualselection.html

That means if 2 males offer equal amount of money, say $20k per year. A beautiful woman **may** very reasonably prefer to choose the richer one that earn 1 million per year and have 20 other hot babes than be the only one for the one that earn only $20k per year. Marriage terms would kick the former. Anti prostitution laws may also kick the former option.

There is something called the "marriage gradient" http://family.jrank.org/pages/1136/Marriage-Squeeze-Mating-Gradient.htmlthat hypothesizes that women want to marry "up," economically. If this is true, women at the top of the professional and economic heap will have trouble finding a "higher" (status) man to marry. Likewise, men at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder won't have many women look "up" to them.
