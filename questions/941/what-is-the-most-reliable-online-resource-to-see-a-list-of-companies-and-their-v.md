<p>Please visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_by_revenue" rel="nofollow">List of Companies By Revenue</a> on Wikipedia. Also Financial Times publishes <a href="http://media.ft.com/cms/253867ca-1a60-11e0-b003-00144feab49a.pdf" rel="nofollow">Global 500</a> every year.</p>

Another decent data source is Value Line (subscription).   The 30 Dow components are free:
