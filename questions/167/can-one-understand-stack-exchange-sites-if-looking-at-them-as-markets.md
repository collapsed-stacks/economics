Often, when I explain friends, who are economists, about the principles of a Stack Exchange, I discover that they cannot get such an exchange to fit into their framework of a market, and therefore do not believe that Stack Exchanges are viable in the long term. The definition I would like to use for a market is that it is a place where one can exchange something of value (in this case, knowledge) for the benefit of both parties. I understand that, if for example the reputation points are considered the currency in this market, then it is a currency with most peculiar properties.
