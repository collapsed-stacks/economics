If everyone worked one less day (another holiday), industry would need one more employee for every [240][1] employees who take the day off. Surely the results would depend on many factors including: Would industry hire the necessary people to make of the difference? Would demand for goods increase or decrease as a result of the holiday?  

Is it possible to estimate the net effect on employment?

<p>This is pretty much the textbook example of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy" rel="nofollow">lump of labor fallacy</a>.</p>

<p>As far as identifying the specific effects of such a policy, it is quite difficult as the government rarely introduces new holidays.  I would say, if you wanted to tackle this problem, your best bet would be to do a diff-in-diff study using Arizona and MLK day, but I wouldn't hold out for statistically significant results.</p>

It's doubtful a national holiday would raise employment with all other things being equal (no gains in productivity, capital, population, etc.)

Why?  Because a person must produce something before they can consume something.  Thus, production always precedes consumption.  With less production (e.g. a national holiday) people will not be able to consume as much resulting in a drop in demand for goods.
