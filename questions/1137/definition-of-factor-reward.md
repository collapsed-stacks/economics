I have been studying the Heckscher–Ohlin model and have seen this phrase come up in papers about it, but have not seen a definition. Could someone let me know what it is?

This expression has little to do with the Hecksher–Olin model. “Factors” here is short for production factors, and their “reward” is simply their share of the revenue.

Heckscher–Ohlin is a theorem that explains, among other things, what “rewards” production factors can attain in an open economy.

<p>According to the Wikipedia entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolper%E2%80%93Samuelson_theorem" rel="nofollow">the Stolper-Samuelson theorem</a>, factor rewards are</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>specifically, real wages and real returns to capital.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the way, I'm no expert on this -- <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Heckscher%E2%80%93Ohlin%20factor%20reward#" rel="nofollow">I googled it.</a>  Perhaps someone else can provide more context.</p>
