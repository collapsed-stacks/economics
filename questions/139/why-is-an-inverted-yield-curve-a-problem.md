Immediately preceding the worst of the financial crisis, my professors all pointed out to me that the yield curve had inverted -- short-term yields were more risky than 20-year or 30-year Treasury securities. My professors all seemed nervous about this. 

Aside from such a situation being generally counter-intuitive, why was this viewed so negatively? What kind of effects does this have, in a more macro sense?
