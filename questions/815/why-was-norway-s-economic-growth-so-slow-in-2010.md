I just learned that Norway's real GDP only grew by 0.447% in 2010. I thought all Nordic countries were doing just fine - the real GDP of Sweden grew by 5.536% and Finland's grew by 3.122% in the same time span - but it seems something happened to Norway in 2010.

Why did Norway have such lackluster growth that year?
