## Why does a freemium product not break the model?

I've noticed that a lot of companies offer their products in a "freemium" model, where they allow people to use the basic version of their product for free, then charge for premium features that go above and beyond. (Examples include [Google Apps][1] and [Trello][2].) 

How does this work? Economically, people have a willingness to pay at every price point. How is free/not free able to work? Does this basically give consumers all the surplus? Does this create any deadweight losses? Am I using the wrong consumer model?
