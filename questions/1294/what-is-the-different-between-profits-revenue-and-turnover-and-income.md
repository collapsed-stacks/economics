Let say I have \$1000, and I buy \$100 of oranges from the farmer, 
and employ a man to help me and pay him \$30, and sell the oranges for \$300. 

So, in this case, what is my profits, revenue, turnover and income?

**Turnover** is used to mean different things in different contexts. It can mean the same as **revenue**. It can also mean the rate at which staff or capital assets are replaced - but from the context of this particular question, it can't be that.

In a business with no balance sheet and a sole owner, **income** and **profits** are the same thing. As soon as there's a balance-sheet involved, that is no longer true: however, in this question, there's no balance sheet.

Revenue / turnover is the aggregate value achieved of all sales in a defined period: in your case, that's \$300.

In this very simple example, income/profits equals revenue/turnover minus total costs. In this case, revenue/turnover is \$300. Total costs are \$100 (cost of oranges) plus \$30 (cost of the person you have employed); that gives total costs of \$130.

So income/profits are \$300 - \$130 = \$170.
