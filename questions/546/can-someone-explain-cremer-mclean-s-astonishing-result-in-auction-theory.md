In mechanism design/auction theory, there is a famous result by Cremer and Mclean that if agents'/bidders' valuations are even slightly correlated, then all the surplus can be extracted by the principal/auctioneer. This is what makes auction theory *without* i.i.d. valuations an unpopular research topic even though it's interesting from a practical point of view.

My question is: Can someone explain to me *why* the Cremer-Mclean result is true?

The original paper is Econometrica 1998, ["Full extraction of the surplus in Bayesian and dominant strategy auctions"](http://www.jstor.org/pss/1913096) by Cremer and Mclean.

There is an explanation [beginning on page 151](http://books.google.com/books?id=qW1128ktG1gC&lpg=PP1&dq=auction%20theory&pg=PA151#v=onepage&q=extraction&f=false) in Vijay Krishna's *Auction Theory* textbook.
