According to wikipedia, [grade inflation][1] is the tendency of academic grades for work of comparable quality to increase over time.  That article also includes plenty of evidence for the phenomenon and lists some potential causes.  Has this issue been studied using game theory?  What game-theoretic models of the educational grading process exist that could shed some light on the forces behind this phenomenon?
