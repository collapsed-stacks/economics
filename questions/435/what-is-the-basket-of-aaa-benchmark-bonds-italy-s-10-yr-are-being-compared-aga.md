There is a lot of reports on Italy's 10 year bond yield approaching the 450 basis points over a benchmark of AAA bonds figure. 

But where are details of the benchmark published?

Typically, the Benchmark are German bonds of the same maturity. However, if there is a basket then without a citation I assume this is the basket of all sovereigns with AAA scores:

The bond basket in question is a proprietary one from clearing house LCH Clearnet consisting of French, Dutch & German government bonds.
