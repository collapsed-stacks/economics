I would like to use disaggregated data (i.e., by U.S. producer or affiliate) on Direct Investment from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), but I can only find aggregated data (i.e., by country or by industry).

Here is the [link][1] to where I thought that I would find disaggregated data, but here both annual and benchmark surveys are aggregated data.

Are the individual survey responses available? I typically use either Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) or the St. Louis Federal Reserve Database (FRED) for data and would appreciate any pointers for BEA data.

If I understand your question, you would like a get data at the firm level (i.e. the direct investment from a particular firm). Unfortunately, if this is what you are looking for, you will not find it I am afraid. The BEA (and other government agencies that disclose public data) does not disclose data at the firm level due to privacy issues. Even if they did not disclose the name of the firm it would be possible is some cases to back into the firmâ€™s identity. This is why you will only find the data at the industry level. In some case, (particularly if you work for a public university) one can get access to the firm level data, but this requires special clearance, which is limited and hard to get. Hope this helps!
