My understanding of the US income tax system is that some couples filing as married pay more income tax than if they were not married and filing as single.  I also understand that some couples pay less income tax filing as married than they would had they not been married and filed single.

Paying more when married is refered to as the "marriage penalty" and while I understand policy has been attempting to combat it, I'm wondering where the U.S. stands today.

How much more or less income tax revenue would the United States make if everyone filed single (rather than married)?
