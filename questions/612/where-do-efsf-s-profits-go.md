If the EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility) borrows money at a low interest and then lends it at a slightly higher interest, then what happens with the profit once the borrowed money is payed back?

<p>Just to clarify, the EFSF is a lending facility that was created by the European Central Bank (ECB).  The facility itself does not do any borrowing or lending, that is done by the banks.</p>

<p>The profit from lending is kept by the <a href="http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/capital/html/index.en.html" rel="nofollow">ECB in its general reserve fund or distributed</a> to its member banks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The net profit of the ECB shall be transferred in the following order:</p>
  
  <p>(a)   an amount to be determined by the Governing Council, which may not
  exceed 20% of the net profit, shall be transferred to the general
  reserve fund subject to a limit equal to 100% of the capital;</p>
  
  <p>(b)   the remaining net profit shall be distributed to the shareholders
  of the ECB in proportion to their paid-up shares.</p>
</blockquote>
