I am looking for papers discussing the equity risk premium that include data after the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recovery. I am wondering whether the volatility during that period helps resolve the equity risk premium puzzle at all.

Of course, the starting date of the data matters tremendously as well, but I am not picky at this point as I currently find any papers from decent journals on the topic after 2009.
