WW2 is well known for helping the US economy.

Did WWI have a similar impact?

This is quite a loaded question and as suggested by some of the comments attached to this; I would narrow down the focus of this question. However, this is an interesting paper on the NBER website by Hugh Rockoff entitled “UNTIL IT’S OVER, OVER THERE: THE U.S. ECONOMY IN WORLD WAR I.” The link to the paper is listed below. Hope this will be useful in asking your question(s).
