## Is there a Eurozone equivalent of the CRSP value-weighted index?

I'm writing a paper about the relationship between the ECB interest rates announcements and the stock market. I was inspired by an academic paper by Kuttner & Bernanke in which they analyze the relationship between the interest rate announcements and the US stock market returns. They used the CRSP value-weighted index returns as benchmark.

What benchmark index should I use if I want to study the relationship between the ECB announcements and the European stock market?

I thought about the euronext 100. What do you think about it? Is it correct?

Or is there a corresponding index to the CRSP index in Europe?
