Within the United States, doing a simple Google search for "Cost of Living Comparison" returns a number of websites attempting to provide econometric comparisons between locations based on city-name/zipcode.

For the average person(s) doing cost of living comparisons between cities within the United States using common econometric, how might they evaluate a source for doing cost of living comparisons? 

Ask because after gathering a limited random samplings of city econometric data from a few of the top results Google returns, the data in some cases had varied by huge amounts. Further, I was unable to track-down the basis for these variations, nor am I able to figure out how to evaluate a source for doing cost of living comparisons in general.
