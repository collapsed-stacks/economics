A few days ago I found this [TED talk on economic inequality][1] by Richard Wilkinson.
The subject of the talk is the effects of inequality within a society, on the general well-being. Here is an excerpt from the talk:

> Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just
> the poor who are affected by inequality. There seems to be some truth

Thus, that there might be a *negative* effect on the upper-class' well-being from inequality.

Currently I have to write a paper on exactly this question, i.e. does inequality have a negative effect on the (upper-class') well-being.

My question: what are good sources on this subject? For instance, the TED talks mentions a few other studies that support him, and mentions there is also criticism on his findings - both of which I cannot find.

<p>The comprehensive one-stop shop for references is the bibliography of the book that Richard Wilkinson wrote with Kate Pickett, <a href="http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/SearchResults?an=wilkinson&amp;bt.x=0&amp;bt.y=0&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=spirit+level" rel="nofollow">The Spirit Level - Why Equality is Better for Everyone</a></p>
