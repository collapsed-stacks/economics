Economies of scale and scope indicates that a large company will in general be more profitable than a smaller one. Is there any statistical material that supports this? Of course, the interesting comparison is to look at profit/income ratio for large companies compared to small ones. 

EDIT: So far this question has gotten two answers regarding the factors involved and how they interact, but this question is really asking about statistical material and therefore references to such material.
