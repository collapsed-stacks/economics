## Interest rates and bonds: What is their relation?

I read in a study text that:

 - When interest rates are *decreasing*, investors will migrate their bonds from short- to longer-term ones
 - When interest rates are *increasing*, investors will migrate their bond holdings from longer-term to shorter ones

I don't fully understand why this would be, but I think this would have to be due to risk management and/or an attempt to take advantage of large movements in bond price.

Could anyone shed some light here to help me to understand what the relation between interest rates and bonds?
