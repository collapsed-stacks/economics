One of the things which [makes econometrics unique][1] is the use of the Generalized Method of Moments technique.

What types of problems make GMM more appropriate than other estimation techniques?  What does using GMM buy you in terms of efficiency or reduced bias or more specific parameter estimation?

Conversely, what do you lose by using GMM over MLE, etc.?
