Suppose we have two firms with specialized, but similar products. Suppose market demand for the two products is:
$$p_1(q_1,q_2)=a-bq_1-dq_2$$
$$p_2(q_1,q_2)=a-bq_2-dq_1$$
where $d \in (-b,b)$. Suppose that both firms have cost $c(q)=q$

What does $d$ mean intuitively?
Is the Cournot Nash Equilibrium for this
$$q_1=\frac{2ba - ad + dc'(q_2)-c'(q_1)2b}  {1 - d^2}$$
$$q_2=\frac{2ba - ad + dc'(q_1)-c'(q_2)2b}  {1 - d^2}$$
Thanks a ton.
