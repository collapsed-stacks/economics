Marriage and prostitution clearly aren't perfect substitutes, but is there a positive cross elasticity between prostitution and marriage?  

For example, would raising the cost of (or prohibition of) prostitution increase demand for marriage?  Or, conversely, would raising cost of marriage increase prostitution?
