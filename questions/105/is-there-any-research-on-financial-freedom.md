## Is there any research on "financial freedom"?

A measure of someone's surplus wealth is, might be captured by this question: "How much could you spend right now, without having to face any consequences in the future?" Such consequences would include having to pay a credit card bill in the future, or change one's way of life.

This question does not capture the same as asking about the amount of savings, because savings-rates in many countries are high because the people are facing a lot of risks. Nor does it refer to discretionary income, which is related, but would relate to recurring expenditure. This is a question specifically about surplus wealth, rather than surplus income.

Is such a measure used in any research or theories? What is such a measure called?
