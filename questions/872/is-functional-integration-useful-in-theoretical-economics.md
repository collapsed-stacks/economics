[Definition of functional integration here][1]

> Functional integration is a collection of results in mathematics and
> physics where the domain of an integral is no longer a region of
> space, but a space of functions. Functional integrals arise in
> probability, in the study of partial differential equations and in
> Feynman's approach to the quantum mechanics of particles and fields
