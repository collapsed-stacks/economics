This seems to be one of the most contentious arguments over the new health care bill that goes into effect in 2014. Setting aside the political issues and the arguments of whether the mandate is legal under the US constitution, will the individual mandate help lower public health care costs in the long run?

Will this lowering just be a shifting of costs from the government to individuals or corporate health care plans?

Not sure if this is too general a question and I realize whole dissertations could be written on this subject.
