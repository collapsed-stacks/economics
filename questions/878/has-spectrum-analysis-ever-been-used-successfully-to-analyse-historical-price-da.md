Spectrum analysis is often used to analyse waveforms, a common configuration for example is to create a graph where X is time, Y is freqancy and the brightness of each position represents amplitude.

Has spectrum analysis ever been used successfully as an indicator to analyse historical price data, for example the price of shares over time?
