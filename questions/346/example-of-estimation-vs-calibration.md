What's a good example to demonstrate the difference between estimation and calibration?

Edit: I'm looking for something that has the same definition of "calibration" and "estimation" that Krugman uses [here][1] (i.e. that they are in some way substitutes):

> “calibration” — which basically means tweaking the parameters of your model until it fits some aspects of the data, rather than flat-out estimating the model
