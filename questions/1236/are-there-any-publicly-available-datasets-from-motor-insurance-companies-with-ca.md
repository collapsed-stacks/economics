I need data from one or more motor insurance companies for my econometric GLM model. Recent data, and data from around the year 1960, would be very useful.

I want to estimate risk premium, using information on age, size of car, accidents, etc

I've checked the sources at http://economics.stackexchange.com/q/179/104

I know the data is commercially valuable; but are there any such datasets on the Internet?
