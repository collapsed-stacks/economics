I want math explanation of common NLP claims. One of them is the idea that if you change your expectation you change your fortune. It's in most success seminars.

Prospect theory says that if you change your expectation you change your utility function, your preference, your action, and hence, of course, your fortune. I want to see if this can be explained more "nerdily."
