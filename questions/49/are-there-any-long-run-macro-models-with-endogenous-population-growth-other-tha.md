Long-run macro models (e.g Solow) tend to hold population growth constant.

Are there any canonical "very long-run" macro models (other than Malthus) that make population growth endogenous?

As far as I am aware no major 'growth theory' paper in economics tries to explain **why** population grows in the manner it does, in contrast to Malthus whose aim was to explain the patterns in population growth around the world and over time. That said, some papers do make population growth endogenous in a simple way in order to see the effect of this new feature on steady state level of growth, etc. Examples:

EDIT: This one seems to take demographics quite seriously:
