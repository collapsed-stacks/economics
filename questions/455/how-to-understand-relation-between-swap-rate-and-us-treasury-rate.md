Why is the swap rate normally above the US Treasury rate - i.e. why is the swap spread normally positive? In 2010, the swap rate was below the US Treasury rate - does that imply an expanding or shrinking economy?

<p>The swap rate is based on interbank lending rates. Therefore the swap spread includes credit risk of AA financial intermediaries and it virtually always trades above on-the-run treasuries of the same maturity. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e803df02-9b33-11df-baaf-00144feab49a.html#axzz1d9x4vpw3" rel="nofollow">Suggestions</a> for why the swap spread (i.e. swap rate - treasury rate) went negative briefly is that many corporations issue significant fixed-rate debt and then used swaps to change their interest rate risk from fixed to floating. When entering a swap these firms are competing to receive fixed (i.e. bidding yields down). These swaps tend to narrow the spread between corporate and treasuries.</p>

<p>Still, it is difficult to have a satisfying answer to this. Times of severe financial distress do produce bizarre outcomes and temporary arbitrage opportunities. For example, the T-Bills traded at negative yields -- essentially investors were willing to give up some principal to hold a risk-free asset -- this violates the time value of money.</p>
