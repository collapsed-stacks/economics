Negro, Perri and Schivardi published a [paper][1] for the New York Fedin 2010 suggesting tax buyouts.  The idea is simple: At the beginning of each year, taxpayers settle their debt with the IRS for a fixed value and whatever they make extra is theirs to keep, so the marginal tax rate is in effect 0%.

That first link is a working paper: it's also available as a [policy paper][2], and as an easier-to-read [magazine article][3], each from the Minneapolis Fed. (though all three versions are by the same authors)
