GDP is so widely used to measure economic growth, even though is has a range of well-known problems. Specifically, there are issues with measuring the significant black-economy, not measuring self-sustaining households, etc. 

Are there any available alternative measures that one can access or easily create that gives a clearer picture of economic growth?

<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/5504103" rel="nofollow">The Economist</a> has a discussion on this relating to GDP per capita vs gross national income vs net national income (amongst others).  In my own work I find that a range of these is necessary to get an idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>GDP per capita is useful only if wealth is widespread and well-reported; useless in Cameroon, for instance, where - outside of a narrow elite who pocket immense oil revenues - just about everyone is a subsistance farmer;</li>
<li>GDP per capita for the top/bottom 10/20% is also useful as a measure that distribution and the potential spending power at each end of the market; if the data is good enough (rare) you may even be able to track growth in these disparate ends;</li>
<li>Purchasing Power Parity versions of these are useful as well, but it really depends on what you're trying to evaluate (imported goods, for instance, aren't going to benefit from PPP);</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that, outside of these narrow bands, few data are tracked sufficiently well to ensure robust analysis.  The IMF publishes their World Economic Outlook twice annually which is a useful starting point (<a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/02/weodata/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">September release here</a>).  Here you can use imports / exports / balance of payments and level of debt as proxies.</p>

<p>In markets with little substantive data (especially in the African emerging markets) I like to fall back on the reported sales of prepay mobile phone cards as these are almost a parallel currency.  This can give you a tremendous insight into the growth and scale of the shadow economy.</p>
