## Is physical gold inflation-proof?

I always assumed that physical gold is inflation-proof, but my advisor at my bank claimed it is not - unfortunately without going into details. Now I wonder what he meant.

My assumption was: If I buy gold now for \$100 and that inflation reduces the value of the Dollar by 50%, I will be able to sell my gold for \$200. The \$200 are worth the same as my \$100 before deflation.

Conclusion - Gold is inflation-proof. But by this simple logic every physical entity that does not lose intrinsic value over time is inflation-proof.  Am I wrong here or is it really that simple?
