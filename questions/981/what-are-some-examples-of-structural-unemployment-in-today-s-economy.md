Wikipedia has the following definition for Structural unemployment:

> Structural unemployment is a form of unemployment resulting from a
> mismatch between demand in the labour market and the skills and
> locations of the workers seeking employment. Even though the number of
> vacancies may be equal to, or greater than, the number of the
> unemployed, the unemployed workers may lack the skills needed for the
> jobs; or they may not live in the part of the country or world where
> the jobs are available.

**Detroit**'s unemployment rate is huge: the car-manufacturing that once formed a mainstay of the city's employment has moved away, the specific skills needed have evolved too, and so Detroit is left with a labour force that is insufficiently mobile, leaving the city with structural unemployment.

Structural unemployment can happen wherever a workforce is insufficiently mobile, in terms of skills or geography. So find anywhere in the world where a sector that was a major employer, has undergone a big move, in terms of **where** it employs people, and/or the skills it requires, and you may find structural unemployment.

Don't confuse this with cyclical unemployment: construction has high unemployment rates in a lot of the developed world ex-BASIC at the moment: but that's only because construction itself is in a trough; not because it's moved.

At least where I'm from, one prime example is the tech industry, particularly software.  Qualified candidates are few and far between.  Unfortunately I can't find a good reference for this, but I assure you that it's very apparent and growing companies are suffering because of it.
