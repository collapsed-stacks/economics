I understand MVPL is marginal variable product of labor, and MRPL is marginal revenue product of labor. What is the difference between the two?
Thanks!

Definitions

 - MP<sub>L</sub> = The change in output (Product) from hiring one more
   unit of labour  
 - MR = Marginal Revenue (The change in revenue from
   hiring one more unit of labour) 
 - P = Price
 - W = Wage

Now assuming that there are no other additional costs (such as investments)

In any market a company will hire labour as long as the Marginal Revenue (MR) > W and the benefit is MRP<sub>L</sub> = MP<sub>L</sub> x MR

But in a perfect competition, MR = P, and therefore MRP<sub>L</sub> = P x MP<sub>L</sub>, which is called Marginal Value Product MVP<sub>L</sub> but in a monopolistic situation MR &#8800; Market Price, fact it is less than the market price and the demand is only MRP<sub>L</sub>

So Marginal Value Product per unit of labour (MVP<sub>L</sub>) is the Marginal Revenue Product per unit of labour (MRP<sub>L</sub>) under perfect competition.

Marginal Variable product (of labor, or anything else), refers to volume, or quantity of the marginal product produced by the last unit of labor.

Marginal REVENUE product refers to the MONEY value of the marginal product. It would be the MVPL times the monetary amount per unit.
