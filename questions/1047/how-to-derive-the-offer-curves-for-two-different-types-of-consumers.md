I have solve the problem of utility maximization for the two consumer types subject to their income constraints, thus obtaining the demand functions of good 1 and good 2 for the two consumer types respectively.

How do I proceed to derive the offer curve for consumer type A, and the offer curve for consumer type B? Say I have normalized the price of good 1 to the price of good 2 to be p.
