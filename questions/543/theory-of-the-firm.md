For any profit maximising, perfectly competitive firm, the following are true:

 1. $MR=MC$ (profit maximising condition)
 2. $P=MR$ (This is an identity; a characteristic of perfect competition)
 3. $P=ATC$ (This is the long-run zero profit condition)

Together the three give you $MC=ATC$. The quantity at which the marginal cost equals the average total cost is your long-run equilibrium quantity.

In your example, $ATC=TC/y=1+y+(F/y)$ and $MC=1+2y$. Therefore, $y^*=\sqrt{F}$.
