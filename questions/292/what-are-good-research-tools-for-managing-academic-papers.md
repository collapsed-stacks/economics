In conducting research, I often have to manage dozens or even hundreds of pdf files. Does anyone have recommendations for programs?

I use Mendeley, I like the GUI interface.  Wikipedia gives a good rundown of a number of different reference management programs at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_management_software .

<p>There are a number of enterprise solutions for this and, as long as all you wish to do is manage documents (collaboration with documents is a different matter), here are a few recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.globalintelligence.com/" rel="nofollow">GIA</a> - Standard enterprise content management;</li>
<li><a href="http://northernlight.com/" rel="nofollow">Northern Light</a> - Enterprise content management, quite expensive but quite comprehensive;</li>
<li><a href="http://publishinteractive.com/" rel="nofollow">Publish Interactive</a> - Well worth exploring for their ability to slice-and-dice pdf reports and "roll your own";</li>
<li><a href="http://www.savogroup.com/" rel="nofollow">Savo</a> - Standard enterprise content management, similar to Northern Light &amp; GIA;</li>
<li><a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/pages/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">Sharepoint</a> - Microsoft's system is actually very good for organising and sharing content;</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have the skills and wish to build your own system, then I recommend <a href="http://rosarior.github.com/mayan/" rel="nofollow">Mayan EDMS</a> which is an open-source (GPLv3), Django (Python)-based platform.  From their blurb:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open source, Django based document manager with custom meta-data
  indexing, file serving integration, document tagging and OCR
  capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are into latex I think I simple bibtex library file will do. Couple that with a program like <a href="http://icculus.org/referencer/" rel="nofollow">referencer</a> (on linux) and you have also a centralized index of where those pesky pdfs are.</p>

<p>If the problem is sharing with other team-mates we found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" rel="nofollow">version control</a> programs to be the easiest way to be always updated. Yes, version control was designed for source codes but work fantastically with documents as well.</p>

I recommend <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> - it's very easy to use, integrates to browser and MS Word/OpenOffice, autogenerates citations and more.
