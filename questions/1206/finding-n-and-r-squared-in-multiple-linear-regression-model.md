For an estimated egression of the form:

Yi = b0 + b1*X1 + b2*X2 + ei for i=1...N where b0 b1 and b2 are all OLS esimators

And given the following:

a matrix BETA containing the estimators

the var-cov(BETA) 

the standard error of the regression

How can I use this information to calculate the R-Squared and the Number of observations?
