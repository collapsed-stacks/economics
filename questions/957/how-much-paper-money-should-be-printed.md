Is there any simple way to judge that? 

Is there any channel to view that number in history?

<p>There is no simple way to judge that, demand of money in a country defines how much money we need to print and that depends on many economical, cultural and political factors.</p>

<p>What you're asking about is technically called "<strong>money in circulation</strong>". The amount of money in circulation differs in countries according to many economical factors.</p>

<p>But usually in developed countries "money in circulation" is around 4% of that country's <strong>liquidity</strong>. In other countries that might be more. For example in some countries during war-time this amount reaches 15%.</p>

<p>Money supply data are recorded and published, usually by the government or the central bank of the country.</p>
