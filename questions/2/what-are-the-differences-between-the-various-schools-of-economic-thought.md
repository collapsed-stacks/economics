I was an business economics major (applied economics, for the armchair economists out there) and often was told that certain ideas were hallmarks of the Keynesian, Austrian, Chicago, Neoclassicist, or other schools of thought. But I was never given the full breakdown as to what this really means -- for a long time, I thought economics was just....economics!

So, how do the various different schools of economic thought compare? In what fields/sectors/locations are these schools of thought most prevalent/popular?
