I'm writing a master thesis partially related to economy. I've seen the different movies on money creation and the economy that are relevant to my subject, namely "Money as Debt", "Money Masters" and "Wizard of Oz". As citing anything not peer reviewed is a bad habit in academic circles, I'd like to find some approachable scientific papers, publications or books related to the topics covered in those books (money supply, creation, inflation, different coinage, etc.), can anyone suggest any sources? (preferably something that a non-economist can understand)

<p>Shiller and Akerlof describe The Wizard of Oz as a metaphor for monetary economics in <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0691142335" rel="nofollow">Animal Spirits</a>. <br>
Page 64 of the paper back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The yellow brick road and Dorothy's magical silver slippers (replaced for the 1939 movie with ruby slippers since these showed up more dramatically on color film) were metaphors for the intense conflict over the gold standard and the proposed free coinage of silver. The little people, the munchkins, represented the poor working class. The wicked witch stood for the selfish business interests. The wizard himself was the great deceiver, the U.S. president.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I also know this view is hotly disputed, since Baum was probably against free silver.</p>
