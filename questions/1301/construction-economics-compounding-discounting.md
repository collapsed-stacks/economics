A company which owns and operates a large city centre hotel is considering installing a new heating system. The annual fuel and maintenance cost of the present system is £50,000. The new system will cost £250,000 to install and its annual fuel and maintenance costs will be £20,000. If the company installed improved insulation in the hotel, at a cost of £39,000, at the same time as replacing the heating system, the annual fuel and maintenance costs would be reduced by £10,000.

Assuming an interest/discount rate of 5%, compare the values of the company’s expenditures on its heating system over a ten year period for each of the following options:

(i) The company do not install a new heating system.
(ii) The company install a new system but do not improve the insulation.
(iii) The company install a new heating system and improve the insulation.



(i) Present Value (PV) £1 per year = (1 + i)n -1/ i(1 + i)n
                                   £50,000 x (1+0.05)10-1/0.05(1+0.05)10
                                   = £50,000 x 7.7221
                                   = £386,109


(ii) Maintenance costs is £20,000 a year 
     Therefore, amount of £1 per year = (1+i)n-1/i
                                      = £20,000 x (1+0.05)10-1/0.05 
                                      =£20,000 x 12.5779
                                      =£251,558
