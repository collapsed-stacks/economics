For example, if I purchase a book for £10, read it and then sell it for £5 is there some economic term/rule that describes the fact that the item has generated £15 rather than the original £10 sale price?

<p>I think you're looking for the intersection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_good" rel="nofollow">durable</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_%28economics%29" rel="nofollow">nonrival goods</a>. Another way of looking at this issue might be as a kind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_good" rel="nofollow">of club good</a>.</p>

<p>One could argue that this dynamic is already captured in the price since buyers are forward looking and take the option value into account. <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w11421" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> a neat paper by Judith Chevalier and Austan Goolsbee looking at how the demand for college textbooks is impacted by new editions.</p>
