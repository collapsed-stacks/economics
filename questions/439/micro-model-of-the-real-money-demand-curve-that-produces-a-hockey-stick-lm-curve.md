## Micro-model of the real-money demand curve that produces a hockey stick LM curve

In most undergraduate textbooks, the real-money demand curve `M/P = L(i, Y)` generates an LM curve that appears linear in i, Y space. It is often specified by a simple real-money demand model like `M/P = aY - bi`.

Are there any micro-models of real-money demand (e.g. Miller-Orr Inventory Model) that actually produce the hockey-stick LM curve that was central to Hicks' interpretation of Keynes?
