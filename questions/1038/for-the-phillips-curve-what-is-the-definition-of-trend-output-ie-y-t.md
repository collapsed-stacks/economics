## For the Phillips Curve, what is the definition of trend output (ie. $Y_t$)?

I am currently studying the [Phillips curve][1], and the equation for that is:
$$i - i_e = a(Y - Y_t)$$

However, if I am studying the dynamics of inflation over time, is $Y_t$ a constant, or should I model it changing over time? Would appreciate any advice, thanks.

<p>In Phillips' original paper, The Relationship between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wages in the United Kingdom: 1861-1957 (available online <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1958.tb00003.x/pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>), he uses the %change in wage rates as his y variable, and estimates an equation log(y+a)=log(b)+c*log(x) where x is unemployment.</p>

<p>In more modern implementations, such as the one you cite above, output (GDP) is typically assumed to grow at a constant rate, and so if Y is measured as log GDP, Y_t will be linear.</p>
