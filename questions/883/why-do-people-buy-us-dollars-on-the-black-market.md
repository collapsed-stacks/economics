I was reading news articles about [people in Venezuela][1] and [Iran][2] getting a poor exchange rate for US dollars on the black market.  Why do these people need to buy dollars?  Why is it still worth while to buy dollars at an unfavorable black market rate?  Why would Venezuela want to block the sale of dollars?
