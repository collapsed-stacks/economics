By "least circulated", I mean used by the least number of people.  Or, to put the question another way, what is the currency of the smallest country (by population) with an independently-valued currency -- a currency not "pegged" to the U.S. Dollar or any other currency or commodity?

To be clear, this definition would exclude, for instance, the "Djiboutian Franc", because ([according to Wikipedia][1]), it's pegged to the Dollar, and thus is effectively an alias for the USD.

My curiosity is related to [Bitcoin][2], and wondering what it would take for the BTC exchange rate(s) to become relatively stable...  This won't give us any absolutes, of course, but perhaps some insight.

<p>In the Lompoc prison complex (total less than <a href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/weekly_report.jsp" rel="nofollow">4,000 prisoners</a>), <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122290720439096481.html" rel="nofollow">pouches of mackerel are an established currency</a>. That makes it smaller than 5% of the size of the Seychelles Rupee. There will be other, smaller closed communities that also have their own established currency.  Somewhere, there will be a community of less than 50 people with their own established currency.</p>

<p>Okay, I think I've found an answer...  I just started at the bottom of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia's countries-by-population list</a> and worked my way up.</p>

<p>The least populous country with an independent currency appears to be Seychelles, with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seychellois_rupee" rel="nofollow">Seychellois Rupee</a>.  The country has a 2009 estimated population of 84,000.  Not bad; a relatively small number of people.  This currency might not be a stellar example of "stable"... but, still interesting to know.</p>

<p>Other low-user-base, independent currencies I found were...</p>

<ul>
<li>the São Tomé and Príncipe Dobra</li>
<li>the Samoan Tālā</li>
<li>the Vanuatu Vatu</li>
<li>and, the Maldivian Rufiyaa</li>
</ul>

<p>And, perhaps also interesting, it looks like the New Zealand Dollar is the smallest currency (by user-base), that might be considered a major currency (apparently the tenth "most traded" currency by value).</p>

<p>(I'd have posted links for all the other currencies, but StackExchange still won't let me.)</p>
