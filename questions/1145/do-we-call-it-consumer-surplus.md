If I want to buy some milk. If I have a downward demand curve, the price and the amount I'm willing to buy as below:

     P   Q
    10   1
     9   2
     5   3

Now the market price is \$5 so I buy 3 bottles of milk for $15.

The problem is, do I get any 'consumer surplus'? My textbook says the consumer surplus is

     (10-5)+(9-5)+(5-5) = 9

But I doubt it. Since I'm willing to pay \$15 for 3 bottles of milk, the value of these milk(for me) should be about $15. So I don't get any consumer surplus, do I?

You paid 15\$ for the 3 bottles of milk. But that was a bargain since you valued the three bottles 24\$ (bottle1: 10\$ + bottle2: 9\$ + bottle3: 5\$).

Your monetary expenditures: 15\$<br>
Your utility gain: 24\$<br>
Your surplus: 9\$


----------
Then you say:  if my surplus is 24\$ and they charged me 8\$ for 3 bottles I would buy it anyway (surplus 24 = cost 24) so why that's not in the demand?

First, if the price of milk was 8\$ you'd be better off buying only 2 bottles. You'd have surplus 19\$ (bottle1+bottle2) and cost 16\$ with a surplus of 3\$ (better than 0). Buying the third bottle is actually deleterious.

And this explains why it's important to read demand as representing marginal changes.

<p>Consumer surplus is the difference between the largest price you are willing to pay and the price you are actually paying for each unit. I would say that you would be willing to pay $10+9+5=24$ for the 3 quarts at the most. Here's a <a href="http://www.transtutors.com/homework-help/micro-economics/consumer-surplus/consumer-surplus-demand-curve/" rel="nofollow">graphical example</a> that will relate this to the familiar triangle calculation.</p>

<p>Also, you should probably add the homework tag to you question.</p>
