I recently saw this video:

In it [Margret Thatcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher) argues that, even in the face of growing inequality, it is better that we all grow wealthier by even a nominal amount than not growing wealthier at all. What are some good counter-arguments to this?

Arguments against this are usually political rather than economic but here is an economic one.

Marginal utility is lower among the richer than the poorer.
For example, a house may provide less utility to a single millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five. From this some people argue that as a result inequality reduces the sum total of personal utility.

Some research has suggested a more equal society promotes social cohesion with people more likely to trust each other and even reduces the rate of homicide.

Clearly one argument -- that I don't know a formal name for -- would be one that relates wealth to truly scarce resources like land.

If you have 10 people, and 10 acres of land, and \$10 equally distributed (\$1 per person) then on the market each acre will fetch \$1.

If you give \$100 away unequally: \$91 to one person and split the remaining \$9 between the remaining 9 people, and reply the scenario now you have one person with \$92, and the remaining 9 people with \$2. If all of the resources are focused on land, the price-per-acre is now \$11 (original \$10 + \$100 distribution / 10). In this scenario one person can buy 9 parcels, and the remaining 9 are forced to fight over a section of the 10th.
