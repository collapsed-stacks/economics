I'm currently trying to assess the usefulness of using google insight for search to predict initial claim for unemployment in the US. [Choi and Varian][1] have written [an article][2] where they compare out-sample forecast of a AR(1) model and the same model where a google search variable is added. 
I asked this question because I suppose that there is a better benchmark than simple AR(1) model.
