Most of the insurance literature is built up around full insurability.  Yet often due to moral hazard and other factors full insurance up to the welfare loss is not possible.

What standard findings in insurance no longer hold when full insurance is not possible?  What are the implications of this in a world where incomplete insurance/background risk is commonplace?
