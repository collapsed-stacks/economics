When the three major Icelandic banks crashed at the beginning of the financial crisis, why did the Icelandic government choose to bail them out. The reason why I am asking is because these banks were huge compared to the Icelandic GDP. Wouldn't it have been cheaper to let them go down and either start a new national bank to take over the loans, which were likely to get repaid?

<p>My understanding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932011_Icelandic_financial_crisis" rel="nofollow">the wikipedia article on this subject</a> is that the banks were not bailed out, though Icelander's deposits were protected.</p>
