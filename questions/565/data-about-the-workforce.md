Where can I find multidimensional statistics on what the US workforce is working on. By multidimensional, I mean that the statistics divide the workforce into a multitude of categories after things like the percentage of workforce that are working as secretaries, but also the percentage of workers working in the financial sector.

<p><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" rel="nofollow">Bureau of Labor statistics</a> is a good online source for such information.</p>

<p>You'll find links to some tables at the end of page. Like <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t13.htm" rel="nofollow">Table A-13</a>. Employed and unemployed persons by occupation, not seasonally adjusted.</p>
