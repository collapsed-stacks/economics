I've read about the LM curve when studying money market.

![enter image description here][1]

It is said that speculative demand for money is higher than transaction demand for money above the LM curve, and the other way round. What is the correct explanation for this?

The question probably lacks details but if you ask I will try to post what I have found out so far.
