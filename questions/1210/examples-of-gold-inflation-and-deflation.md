Are there examples of **inflation** or **deflation** caused by the discrepancy between the amount of available gold (silver, shells) and the amount of created values? (Up to the end of Bretton Woods, obviously.)

One such example could be the 16th century [price revolution][1], although the Wikipedia article is bit contradictory on the causes of the inflation.

How about the "Great Deflation" of 1879-1896:

> [P]rices fell at a rate of over 1 percent per year in this period.
> Just as in the previous period, the money supply grew, but not fast
> enough to overcome the great increases in productivity and the supply
> of products.

From M. N. Rothbard, *A History of Money and Banking in the United States*, p. 159.
