Are employees required to disclose purchases and sales of their own companies stocks? If yes, are these disclosures publicly available? If yes, where? 

Where do companies such as [INK Research][1] get their "insider" data?

<p>As @Chad mentioned in a comment, employees and CEOs must report their trades with the SEC. You might want to check the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm" rel="nofollow">EDGAR</a> database. <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/form11-k.pdf" rel="nofollow">Form 11-K</a> might be a good place to start.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here's an <a href="http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/forms/edgform.pdf" rel="nofollow">index</a> explaining what each form is used for. The SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm" rel="nofollow">provides information</a>, including what forms to inspect, for tracking insider trading activity.</p>

<p>It occurs to me the OP might have been interested in illegal trading activity, which of course, wouldn't be tracked by these SEC forms.</p>
