I'm studying published journal articles on my topic, and I'd like to reproduce their analysis.  How can I get a copy of their dataset and enough specifications to reproduce their numeric results?

In my specific case, I'm studying [Stecklov et al. (2005)](http://www.springerlink.com/content/134h2p647654x684/), published in *Demography*, and they're using PROGRESA datasets which are [publicly available](http://evaluacion.oportunidades.gob.mx:8010/en/bases_cuan_c.php), but when I try to reproduce their results, all the base statistics are off by a bit, and the regressions come out a bit different.  Probably I'm just including or excluding a few different cases, but what can I do to identify the difference?
