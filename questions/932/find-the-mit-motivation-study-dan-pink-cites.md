I was sent a [you tube link][1] to a Dan Pink video in which he claims there was study done at MIT that says people are motivated by more than just money.  It was pretty romantic and I actually liked it but I wanted to look at the MIT study he's citing.  I can't find it anywhere.  Website after website discuss the "MIT Study" but I'm unable to even find the name let alone the authors of the study.

Does anyone know the name or have a link to that study Pink cites?  Thank you in advanc

This was a difficult one to track down--odd that the researchers names aren't mentioned (even in Mr. Pink's online writings).

I think you are after the 2005 Boston Fed working paper [Large Stakes and Big Mistakes](http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0511.pdf) by Ariely, Gneezy, Loewenstein and Mazar of MIT, Chicago, CMU and MIT, respectively (as suggested in the video at 2:25). An article with the same title was  published in 2008 in the [Rev. of Economic Studies 76(2)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-937X.2009.00534.x/full), but the authors' institutional affiliations had changed (likely why the article was difficult to find).
