It seems to be generally assumed that making cars safer for the occupants will reduce death, injury, and damage from traffic accidents.

What does economics have to say on this and what are some examples of significant empirical research on this topic? Specifically, [do safety features cause drivers to engage in more risky behavior than they otherwise would](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard)? If so, what is the net effect of additional safety mechanisms?
