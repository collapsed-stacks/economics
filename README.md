This is an archive of the **Economics Stack Exchange** Q&A site that existed from 2011 to 2012. The official proposal and archive of the site [may be found on Stack Exchange Area 51](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618). All content is licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

This archive includes browsable copies of the 1007 questions and answers that existed on the site at the time it was shut down. Each page is a simple markdown file, which may be automatically rendered into a HTML template by GitHub Pages. There is [an index page listing all of the site's `questions/`](https://collapsed-stacks.github.io/economics/questions/), but it's are more suited to consumption by robots than humans.

The `data/` directory includes a copy of contents of the official data dump from Area 51. We also add [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) versions of every XML file for convenience. You can grab this from [GitHub at collapsed-stacks/economics](https://github.com/collapsed-stacks/economics).
