This creates the potential for moral hazard.\r\n\r\nI started thinking about this because of what happened at AIG.  For those unfamiliar with the situation, a small division (AIG Financial Products) in a huge insurance company was able to create enough risk to bankrupt the entire company.

Even though management was making millions, they were taking risks an order of magnitude larger than that.

Under perfect competition, the demand curve represents demand for perfectly substitutable products from many firms.  For example, many agricultural products are perfect substitutes (I don't care if my corn came from farm A or farm B).  In markets for undifferentiated products, there little incentive for firms to engage in marketing activities because other firms will capture much of the benefit (this is why we don't see ads for, say, wheat).  \r\n\r\nHowever, some firms endeavor to create a separate market for their product, usually by branding.  Advertising and other marketing activities can be used to create this separate market and to influence demand in that market.  For example, there was once a market for MP3 players, and each firm's MP3 player was more-or-less a perfect substitute for players  from other firms.  Apple succeeded in differentiating their MP3 player, the iPod, sufficiently to create a separate market.  In this market, Apple could capture the benefits of advertising, and they could also exercise some monopoly powers (as they were the only source of iPods).  \r\n\r\nIn short, firms will only endeavor to influence demand if they can differentiate their product from others, so the real questions firms ask often relate to how they might convince consumers that their product is really different from products of other firms."}

They also have a very instructive survey of previous work in the area.\r\n\r\n- [Kopczuk (2005)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272705000241) makes the case for institutional factors pertinent to tax system design: deductions, for instance, corrode the tax base and act as a tax shelter.\r\n\r\n- [Goolsbee (2000)](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/fichiers/enseig/ecoineg/articl/Goolsbee2000.pdf) \r\n focuses on top earners, specifically highly-compensated CEOs. Similar to Kopczuk, he shows that top earners will use all available technology for buffering-out the effects of increases in tax rates by beating its timing, e.g. by exercising stock options. However, regular compensation schemes indexed to labor supply as we normally perceive it, is not highly responsive.\r\n\r\n- Finally, long-run evidence and policy implications are very clearly presented in [Saez (2004)](http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/NBER10273TPE04.pdf), with a special focus on top incomes.\r\n\r\nHope it helps."}

If inflation is a growth in aggregate money supply, then the bitcoins will not experience deflation (an overall decrease in aggregate money supply).\r\n2. If inflation is an overall increase in average prices of consumer goods, then it is possible for bitcoins to experience deflation (an overall decrease in the prices of consumer goods).\r\n\r\nI will ignore #1 (since it doesn't make sense in the context of your question) and assume you mean definition #2.\r\n\r\nAt first blush, the idea of falling overall prices sounds quite good. Think about the market for PCs, for example. PCs have simultaneously fallen in prices consistently for over 20 years, at the same time getting more powerful and useful. Computer companies are making good money and consumers are getting great products. Win-win.\r\n\r\nThe danger of falling prices has to do with *why* prices are falling. If, as in the case of the PC, prices have fallen slowly over time due to increases in capital concentration and worker productivity, then falling prices are a good thing! We can buy more and better goods with the same amount of money.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, prices fall because the economy is growing but the supply of money is fixed, then this *may* pose problems. There are a few problems commonly called out by critics of deflation, so I'll try to name a few and then offer my opinion:\r\n\r\nA. Deflation encourages savings, not borrowing.\r\n\r\nThis criticism is that the deflation rewards savings and makes borrowing money more costly, so it will shift the balance between savings and lending, perhaps to the detriment of society.\r\n\r\nI disagree with this. Savings and borrowing must occur in equal amounts. I cannot borrow money unless I can find somebody else who has savings to lend to me. The interest rate is the \"price\" associated with saving and borrowing money, and this price should naturally float to a place where the supply of savings is roughly equal to the demand for borrowing.\r\n\r\nB. Price deflation leads to wage deflation/higher unemployment.\r\n\r\nThe criticism here is that lower prices mean lower corporate profits, therefore companies will cut wages or fire workers to stay profitable.\r\n\r\nI disagree because the increase in capital investment and worker productivity each year acts against wage deflation. In other words, prices may be lower, but each worker is also more productive. This effect of productivity may completely offset the decrease in prices.\r\n\r\nIf the effect of increasing productivity is not large enough to offset the decrease in prices, then we still don't have to accept high unemployment. Instead, we might accept that wages may decrease slowly in times of low economic growth. In the US, we expect salaries to inch higher every year, but this expectation is largely based on 100 years of central banking that promotes low-and-slow inflation. I believe that this is a mindset that could be changed slowly if necessary.\r\n\r\nC. Price deflation encourages buyers to defer purchases.\r\n\r\nThe criticism here is that if consumers believe deflation is a trend, then they expect that the value of a car (for example) will be less next year than it is this year, and therefore they will wait to purchase a new car.\r\n\r\nAgain I disagree. People will buy things they need no matter what, such as food, clothing and shelter. Furthermore, there is always a premium to having something now versus in the future, so even if you think a car may be a little cheaper several years from now, you're willing to pay a bit more to have it right now.\r\n\r\nLook at the PC example.

The CBO paper, and papers that cite it, would be a good basis for a literature search on the subject.\r\n\r\nA general conclusion is that the ETI is larger for higher earners while relatively low earners have a smaller response to tax rates, perhaps because their income derives largely from labor, which leaves them constrained to accept whatever tax rate they are obliged to pay.

So most typical cases of unemployment you can think of come under involuntary unemployment (the other common type is frictional unemployment, i.e., unemployment attributable to being 'between jobs').\r\n\r\nWhy is there such a huge debate about this? Believe it or not, until recently most prevailing models, being neo-classical in origin, assumed that unemployment is always voluntary. That is, if someone is not working it's because they do no want to work at the prevailing wage rate. The 2010 winners of the Nobel Prize, Diamon, Mortensen and Pissarides, are commonly credited with fixing these problems by making better employment search models.\r\n\r\nIn the quotation above, Keynes is probably saying that involuntary unemployment arises because the market takes time to adjust. suppose wage is w and the real wage is w/p. At this wage, some agents are willing to work but can't find work. Now if p rises, real wage falls, therefore demand for labour rises. This is why you get both surplus demand and supply of labour. As the market adjusts the surplus demand disappears. (Keynes would have contended that the supply of labour would continue to be in excess of the equilibrium level even in the long run though.)"}

There are just too many different things all happening at the same time to conclusively find meaningful correlations, and even meaningful correlations still can't teach us about cause and effect.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, here goes a crude attempt to show that financialization _can lead to increases in prices_, all other things being equal. I'll do this in 2 steps. First I'll show some data to establish plausibility for this theory. Second, I will explain the reasoning behind my theory to [hopefully] establish causality.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notorious financial products in recent history is the mortgage-backed security (MBS). This financial product allows investors all around the world to easily and relatively safely tap into the US mortgage market.\r\n\r\nHow popular were MBS? They grew in popularity in the late 90's and then exploded in the early 00's.\r\n\r\n![mbs_history_chart][1]\r\n\r\nWhat did home prices look like in this same period?\r\n\r\nHere is the Case Schiller price index since 1890. Notice that this data is in constant dollars. In other words, when the black line goes up, that means housing prices are going up faster than the cost of the average consumer good. \r\n\r\n![case_schiller_history][2]\r\n\r\nLook what happens right around 2000... a huge spike.\r\n\r\nNow as I said above, there are plenty of ways to rationalize away this spike. Cheap US monetary policy, new mortgage products, etc. So although the data _plausibly_ supports my assertion, let me switch to reasoning about why the higher degree of financialization might increase home prices.\r\n\r\nMost home shoppers begin by calculating what they believe they can afford. Usually they start with annual salary and work backwards to some monthly payment that they can handle. Then they start looking for loan products that match their monthly payment. These loan products can finance different amounts of principal depending on their terms. For example, a 15 year mortgage at 5% will finance much less than a 30 year mortgage at 5%. There are other mortgage products that might help you finance even more (get leveraged higher) such as low-LTV loans, ARM loans, reverse-am loans, etc.\r\n\r\nSo let's say two people, Adam and Bob, both want to buy the same house. Both make the same amount of money, but Bob's bank offers exotic and more highly leveraged loan products than Adam's bank. Adam places his bid on the house based on his monthly payment and the amount his bank will let him finance. If Bob had the same financing as Adam, then the story would be over. Bob would not be able to bid any higher since he and Adam have the same leverage.\r\n\r\nBut since Bob actually has higher leverage, he can easily outbid Adam for the house and Adam has no recourse -- Adam is already fully leveraged and cannot bid any higher.\r\n\r\nThis is a highly contrived example, but you can see how financialization can lead to increased leverage, and this in turn enables greater buying power, and greater buying power can bid up the prices. If the buying power of all people generally grows over time (i.e. highly leveraged mortgage products are made available to more people), then we'd expect that to raise prices dramatically since now all bidders would be equipped with greater buying power.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/iXxkZ.png\r\n  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/LrQT3.png"}

Let me provide three simple examples\r\n\r\n - . IS-LM, old Keynesian \r\n\r\nLiquidity trap is a situation when the LM curve is flat. Changes in money supply have no effect on interest rates and interest rates are not low enough (even at 0) to get full employment. Basically AD-AS curves are parallel and never meet.\r\n\r\nIn this world the solution is government spending. With flat LM the IS curve can be very effective and restore traction to the economy. <br>\r\n*Reference:*\r\n\r\n> Heijdra, **Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics**. It is a senior/master level book and the most comprehensive approach to IS-LM. I know of no doctorate level book on the subject. I think IS-LM is \"obsolete\" there.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n - . New Keynesian\r\n\r\nYou can get out of liquidity trap by managing expectations. <br>\r\nTo maximize utility you have to solve a consumption Euler equation. This Euler equation is why interest rates stimulate the economy.<br>\r\nWhile old-Keynesian thinking focuses only on short-term interest rates, the Euler equation contains also \"expected\" long term rates. \r\n\r\nEven though short interest rates are 0 in a liquidity trap, you can still get away by changing consumer expectations of what future interest rates will be. Whether you actually can do it is debatable, but things like *nominal GDP targeting* and *Operation Twist* can be explained with this\r\n\r\n*Reference:*\r\n> Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, **The Liquidity Trap**. That goes straight to the point. To really know more you need a full advanced macroeconomics curriculum.\r\n\r\n - . Balance Sheet Recession\r\n\r\nLiquidity trap and deflation are a consequence of asset prices collapse. Managing them is useless, the only solution is fixing private balance sheets.\r\n\r\nFirms have positive cash flow but are technically bankrupt as the assets have lost value while liabilities have stayed equal. All firms and consumers do is to accumulate cash until they are no more \"bankrupt\". <br>\r\nYou can only help them clean their balance sheet to speed up recovery.\r\n*Reference:*\r\n> Richard Koo, **The Holy Grail of Economics**. A bit high sounding, but interesting."}

What's happened in the PV industry is that there have been many new disruptive entrants into the market - First Solar, and then the Chinese manufacturers - that have brought costs down rapidly.  Pre-existing manufacturers generally have been **less** able to take advantage of the cost reductions from the technological advancement, because the new entrants have brought in new knowhow and new manufacturing processes. Existing players are to a degree saddled with their existing plant and the skills of their current employees.\r\n\r\nThere are further potential technological advancements in PV and in wind, but there are big questions about whether those will accrue to existing players, or be reaped primarily by new ones.

In my own work I find that a range of these is necessary to get an idea:\r\n\r\n - GDP per capita is useful only if wealth is widespread and well-reported; useless in Cameroon, for instance, where - outside of a narrow elite who pocket immense oil revenues - just about everyone is a subsistance farmer;\r\n - GDP per capita for the top/bottom 10/20% is also useful as a measure that distribution and the potential spending power at each end of the market; if the data is good enough (rare) you may even be able to track growth in these disparate ends;\r\n - Purchasing Power Parity versions of these are useful as well, but it really depends on what you're trying to evaluate (imported goods, for instance, aren't going to benefit from PPP);\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, outside of these narrow bands, few data are tracked sufficiently well to ensure robust analysis.  The IMF publishes their World Economic Outlook twice annually which is a useful starting point ([September release here][2]).  Here you can use imports / exports / balance of payments and level of debt as proxies.\r\n\r\nIn markets with little substantive data (especially in the African emerging markets) I like to fall back on the reported sales of prepay mobile phone cards as these are almost a parallel currency.

The fact that reported income is a composite of several sources, as well as tax evasion etc, make the problem even more hairy.\r\n\r\n- A seminal paper is [Feldstein (1995)](http://www.jstor.org/pss/2138698) who uses a diff-in-diff approach centered on the 1986 Tax Reform, to find an elasticity of reported income well in excess of 1, and rising steeply with reported income.\r\n\r\n- Another very important paper is [Gruber & Saez (2002)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272701000858), who use a different identification strategy and a long micro data panel of individual tax returns. The data allow for assessing income effects, since variation is collected from several parts of the income distribution. They also have a very instructive survey of previous work in the area.\r\n\r\n- [Kopczuk (2005)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272705000241) makes the case for institutional factors pertinent to tax system design: deductions, for instance, corrode the tax base and act as a tax shelter.\r\n\r\n- [Goolsbee (2000)](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/fichiers/enseig/ecoineg/articl/Goolsbee2000.pdf) \r\n focuses on top earners, specifically highly-compensated CEOs. Similar to Kopczuk, he shows that top earners will use all available technology for buffering-out the effects of increases in tax rates by beating its timing, e.g. by exercising stock options. However, regular compensation schemes indexed to labor supply as we normally perceive it, is not highly responsive.\r\n\r\n- Finally, long-run evidence and policy implications are very clearly presented in [Saez (2004)](http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/NBER10273TPE04.pdf), with a special focus on top incomes.\r\n\r\nHope it helps."}

You can figure out your own demand curve by doing the following exercise.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nLet's say somebody opens a pizza shop in your neighborhood, and they auction off a bunch of pizzas every night. \r\n\r\nYou are hungry and you're craving pizza, so you would gladly pay $10 for one pizza. You're not hungry enough to eat 2 pizzas yourself, so you wouldn't pay another $10 to get a second pizza. But if the second pizza was only $8 more, then you would go ahead and get one for your roommates to make up for playing loud music the night before.\r\n\r\nAs you think about how much each additional pizza is worth to you, you realize that each additional pizza has less and less appeal. There's only so much you can eat yourself, share with roommates, or refrigerate to eat later. So your willingness to pay more to buy more diminishes as the number of pizzas goes up.\r\n\r\nBefore going to the auction, you write down your preferences on a sheet of paper and bring it with you:\r\n\r\n    Number Of Pizzas    Marginal Price\r\n    1                   $10 \r\n    2                   $8  \r\n    3                   $6  \r\n    4                   $2 \r\n    5                   $1\r\n    6                   $0.50    \r\n    7                   $0.50       \r\n    8                   $0.50      \r\n\r\n\r\nNow you can go to the auction and know exactly what your maximum bid is for each pizza. I.e. you'll bid up to $10 on a pizza until you win your first pizza. Then you will bid up to $8 until you win a second pizza.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nWhat if the pizza restaurant does not auction off pizzas, but instead sets a fixed price for pizzas? Now how would you decide how many pizzas to buy?\r\n\r\nYou can figure this out quickly by taking your notes from the auction and adding two new columns. \"Total\" is a running total of column 2, and \"Price/Pizza\" is Total divided by Number Of Pizzas.\r\n\r\n    Number Of Pizzas    Marginal Price    Total    Price/Pizza\r\n    1                   $10               $10      $10\r\n    2                   $8                $18      $9\r\n    3                   $6                $24      $8\r\n    4                   $2                $26      $6.50\r\n    5                   $1                $27      $5.40\r\n    6                   $0.50             $27.50   $4.58\r\n    7                   $0.50             $28      $4.00\r\n    8                   $0.50             $28.50   $3.56\r\n\r\nThe first column and the fourth column together make a _demand schedule_. If we were to depict those series visually, we would call it a _demand curve_:\r\n\r\n![sample demand curve][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aggregate demand curve for multiple people is easy to find _if you know the demand curves for each individual_. You add up the quantity demanded for each person at each price. I don't know how to write the fancy equations, so here goes:\r\n\r\nD(p) = sum(di(p))\r\n\r\nWhere D is the aggregate demand function, di is the i'th consumer's demand function, and p is price.\r\n\r\nThis is what shapes the demand curve.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this definition of demand is that it doesn't incorporate time as a variable or substitution effects -- other goods that similar but not identical to the good in question. This is why you never see a business owner in the real world whipping up a demand schedule and then charting the results. Most prices are either set \"by feel\" and experimented with, or companies may try to get a rough idea of demand by surveying consumers or conducting focus groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n> Is it purely tastes and preferences, or are there other factors a company may be able to control or influence?\r\n\r\nYes, in this simple model, it's just each individual's preference. A company may be able to control or influence an individual's preference, for example marketing something as \"manly\" so that male customers are more likely to buy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/iGCge.png\r\n\r\n"}

In short, the market decisions that individual agents would make are distorted by the tax, causing an efficiency loss.  But, the usual assumptions don't hold.

Acceptability\r\n 2. Durability\r\n 3. Portability\r\n 4. Scarcity\r\n 5. Divisibility\r\n\r\nNow in the past portability was mostly related to being able to physically transport the currency from one location to another.  I think in the present and future it is more related to being able to make payments between parties that may not be in physical proximity to one another.  Although this can be solved with 3rd party systems like Paypal, some would prefer that be a feature of the currency itself.  So ideally I should be able to instantly transfer money to a merchant across the country or across the ocean.  So it seems we are dealing with some sort of electronic currency.\r\n\r\nThe issue of scarcity in traditional currency is handled either through trust that a government won't print excessive amounts of money or through natural means (e.g. there exists a finite amount of gold in the world).  A futuristic, electronic currency would either have to rely on a trusted 3rd party, a government, or \"built-in\" means to ensure scarcity.  One example of built-in scarcity would be crypto-currencies that rely on certain mathematical properties of cryptography to ensure scarcity.\r\n\r\nNow durability should be no problem for any sensible electronic currency; data can be backed up to one's heart's content.  Divisibility should also be easy for an electronic currency; if `n`units can be represented then it is easy to represent `n/2`, `n/4`, etc. units.\r\n\r\nAcceptability can be the tough part.  A given currency that has all of the other characteristics is more likely to become acceptable, but ultimately it relies on either a government mandate (which does not seem futuristic) or market forces."}

One may think that this is the wrong question to ask, actually, since the macro research is defined by the agenda of issues.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the frontier in academic research nowadays is defined by two main themes: a) general equilibrium models, i.e. interactions in markets via the price mechanism, b) microdata.\r\n\r\n1. The exogenous growth theories ([Solow-Swan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous_growth_model), [Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans_model)) have been abandoned altogether. Apart from the fact that they can't explain stylized facts (mainly convergence and/or divergence of countries from the GDP frontier), they lack many features that are found in the micro-level.\r\n\r\n2. Endogenous growth (as pertains to the [AK model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_growth_model#The_AK_Model), for instance) has been successful in dealing with growth and international relations, for instance. It also paved the way for the current macro literature, namely:\r\n\r\n3. [\"Schumpeterian\" growth theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction). Based on ideas that encompass the imperfect competition schemes that capitalize on innovation and its rewards: an innovation that is patented gives the right to a monopoly profit. Rents generated this way are driving investment and hence constitute a primary engine for long-run growth. Head-to-head competition, barriers to entry, closed vs open technologies, investment in human capital and education - these are all themes that are both interesting and relevant for both academics and policymakers.\r\n\r\nSince economic growth is the result of the confluence of many factors, new research concentrates on political economics as well - the effects of institutions such as law (common vs continental) and political systems (democracy, governance schemes) on economic growth.\r\n\r\nTo read: [Aghion and Howitt](http://books.google.com/books?id=TyZvOQAACAAJ)'s book, the best non-elementary introduction to the subject -- it focuses on issues and mechanisms, and it can be read by anyone, even the non-math oriented economist."}

Now we can get things like natural monopoly\r\n\r\nRegarding 6: if we relax the assumption about profit (or utility, if you're working with the rational consumer model), I don't really know what happens.

You can figure out your own demand curve by doing the following exercise.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nLet's say somebody opens a pizza shop in your neighborhood, and they auction off a bunch of pizzas every night. \r\n\r\nYou are hungry and you're craving pizza, so you would gladly pay $10 for one pizza. You're not hungry enough to eat 2 pizzas yourself, so you wouldn't pay another $10 to get a second pizza. But if the second pizza was only $8 more, then you would go ahead and get one for your roommates to make up for playing loud music the night before.\r\n\r\nAs you think about how much each additional pizza is worth to you, you realize that each additional pizza has less and less appeal. There's only so much you can eat yourself, share with roommates, or refrigerate to eat later. So your willingness to pay more to buy more diminishes as the number of pizzas goes up.\r\n\r\nBefore going to the auction, you write down your preferences on a sheet of paper and bring it with you:\r\n\r\n    Number Of Pizzas    Willing To Pay\r\n    1st                 $10 \r\n    2nd                 $8  \r\n    3rd                 $6  \r\n    4th                 $2 \r\n    5th                 $1\r\n    6th                 $0.50    \r\n    7th                 $0.50       \r\n    8th                 $0.50      \r\n\r\n\r\nNow you can go to the auction and know exactly what your maximum bid is for each pizza. I.e. you'll bid up to $10 on a pizza until you win your first pizza. Then you will bid up to $8 until you win a second pizza.

Now how would you decide how many pizzas to buy?\r\n\r\nYou can figure this out quickly by looking at your notes for the auction. If the price of pizza is $7, then you will definitely buy at least 1 pizza (because the first pizza is worth $10 to you) and you will definitely want a 2nd pizza (because the second pizza is worth $8 at the auction) but you will not buy a 3rd (because the third pizza is only worth $6 to you).\r\n\r\nThe table above is called a _demand schedule_.

You can figure out your own demand curve by doing the following exercise.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nLet's say somebody opens a pizza shop in your neighborhood, and they auction off a bunch of pizzas every night. \r\n\r\nYou are hungry and you're craving pizza, so you would gladly pay $10 for one pizza. You're not hungry enough to eat 2 pizzas yourself, so you wouldn't pay another $10 to get a second pizza. But if the second pizza was only $8 more, then you would go ahead and get one for your roommates to make up for playing loud music the night before.\r\n\r\nAs you think about how much each additional pizza is worth to you, you realize that each additional pizza has less and less appeal. There's only so much you can eat yourself, share with roommates, or refrigerate to eat later. So your willingness to pay more to buy more diminishes as the number of pizzas goes up.\r\n\r\nBefore going to the auction, you write down your preferences on a sheet of paper and bring it with you:\r\n\r\n    Number Of Pizzas    Willing To Pay\r\n    1st                 $10 \r\n    2nd                 $8  \r\n    3rd                 $6  \r\n    4th                 $2 \r\n    5th                 $1\r\n    6th                 $0.50    \r\n    7th                 $0.50       \r\n    8th                 $0.50      \r\n\r\n\r\nNow you can go to the auction and know exactly what your maximum bid is for each pizza. I.e. you'll bid up to $10 on a pizza until you win your first pizza. Then you will bid up to $8 until you win a second pizza.

In this paper, they do allow for abstention. Their proposition 1 states that abstention is strictly preferred by uninformed voters (when they are indifferent between the candidates and when no agent uses a strictly dominated strategy). The intuition they provide for this result is contained in the following. We assume that \"all informed independents vote for the correct candidate in each state\" and \"the correct candidate for the UIA [uninformed independent agents] is the candidate favored by the informed independent voters.\" \r\n\r\n> [T]he uninformed voter strictly prefers to abstain because the only\r\n> way her vote effects the outcome is if she votes for the candidate not\r\n> supported by the informed voter, i.e., the wrong candidate. Given the\r\n> behavior by the other voters, uninformed voters suffer the swing\r\n> voter's curse: they are strictly better off abstaining than by voting\r\n> for either candidate. This is true even though uninformed voters\r\n> believe that the status quo is almost certainly the best candidate. \r\n\r\nFor an experimental analysis of this phenomenon, check out [Battaglini, Morton, Palfrey 2008](http://www.princeton.edu/~mbattagl/swingvoter.pdf). Their laboratory results are consistent with the equilibrium predictions of Feddersen and Pesendorfer's paper. "}

Instead of solving the model with something like Uhlig's (1997) log-linearization or Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe's (2004) approximation of the policy function (or any of the options I get with Dynare), I'd like to write up the agents in the model as objects in code, and step that code forward through time. There are three main obstacles:\r\n\r\n 1. Agents need to have expectations. \r\n 2. Markets need to clear.\r\n 3. The no-ponzi condition needs to be enforced.\r\n\r\n(1) is simple enough. With one agent and one firm (or N identical agents/firms), the HH can form expectations over the true probability distribution of the future. The entire point of constructing this, however, is to allow for this expectations mechanism to be \"swapped out\" with others -- recursive OLS, for example, or Bayesian learning, or even some sort of \"meta-model selection\" as in LeBaron et al. (1999). Regardless, I have not problems here (yet).\r\n\r\n(2) is where I currently have an issue. The tricky thing is that the basic RBC model has three markets -- consumption, labor, capital. The price of consumption is fixed in the original, which I retained, so that market is fine. For the other two markets, my first pass was to essentially create an auctioneer and have it do the tatonnement process. Come up with a price, hand it to agents, gather supply and demand, adjust the prices \"in the right direction,\" and hand them back. This is repeated in a single period until markets clear (supply and demand in all markets are within some epsilon). My first-pass attempt at this was to have a blindingly simple adjustment rule:\r\n\r\n  p' = rho*(XD/XS)*p\r\n\r\nwhere p' is the next-period price for the market under consideration, p is price this period, XD and XS are excess demand and excess supply, respectively, and rho is a simple \"control\" to allow adjustment of the process. This is similar to price adjustment in LeBaron et al. (1999), but here is multiplicative, and my goal here is market clearing each period. \r\n\r\nI quickly ran into some trouble -- my little RBC economy would run to zero in one or other of the markets fairly quickly. This, of course, may be due to a number of things -- I strongly suspect that my expectations process (initially, simple adaptive expectations) and/or the fact that I don't have a no-ponzi condition implemented (...yeah...) are the major things affecting my results. (I suspect I may be \"stepping off the convergent path,\" as it were. Perhaps not technically correct in a discrete-time model...)\r\n\r\nThose, however, are questions for another post. Right now, I'm simply trying to think a little better about the market-clearing process. Does anyone have any suggestions?  I've recently stumbled across the WALRAS algorithm (Cheng and Wellman 1998), but am largely unfamiliar with computational tatonnement-style market clearing. \r\n\r\nAh, and I should note -- the purpose of all this is a few reasons -- one is just reproducing classic results (if possible) in a new way, another is giving myself a framework in which I can easily switch out expectational mechanisms and (eventually) incorporate various forms of agent heterogeneity in a general-equilibrium setting. It's also a fantastic way to review basic models and learn some of the newer developments in agent learning in macro.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n\r\nCheng and Wellman (1998), \"The WALRAS Algorithm: A Convergent Distributed Implementation of General Equilibrium Outcomes,\" Computational Economics, 12(1): 1-24.\r\n\r\nHansen (1985), \"Indivisible Labor and the Business Cycle,\" Journal of Monetary Economics, 16: 309-27.\r\n\r\nLeBaron, Arthur, Palmer (1999), \",\" Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 23: 1487-1516\r\n\r\nSchmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004), \u201cSolving Dynamic General Equilibrium Models Using a Second-order Approximation to the Policy Function,\u201d Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 28(4): 755\u201375.\r\n\r\nUhlig (1997), \"A toolkit for analyzing nonlinear economic dynamic models easily,\" Working paper."}

And if we were starting with a *tabula rasa*, a blank slate, then that would be the right level too.\r\n\r\nHowever, such a tax (for example a carbon tax) is, in the real world, introduced into a market where capital investment has already taken place, leaving the market far from the equilibrium, and far from the optimal resource allocation that could be found if the externality had been internalised all along. That's because the marginal cost for incumbents will be lower than their average cost, in the short- to medium- term. They already have sunk costs, in their fixed asset base: factories, workforce skills, institutional structures. These incumbents with sunk costs slow down the move to a new equilibrium, and can act as a barrier-to-entry to disruptive new entrants who would otherwise catalyse the move to the new equilibrium.\r\n\r\nSo, if one didn't want to model all capital investments, but wanted a less data-intensive means of estimating the appropriate level of Pigouvian tax to minimise unnecessary damage and bring the market to new equilibrium in an orderly, but prompt manner, what information would be needed, to trade off the cost of stranded assets versus the cost of delay?"}

If their formulation of policy choice really does imply that there is always a unique, knowable solution, then their model is not useful for cases where we can demonstrate that there is *not* a unique knowable solution.\r\n\r\nIt's not difficult to construct a set of scenarios where the optimal policy problem has several solutions, or at least, one where the uncertainties swamp the expected differences between differences, so that there is no *significant* difference in total expected welfare between solutions. \r\n\r\nAnd so, to answer the direct question: in such cases as above, the private sector *cannot* know which optimal policy the central planner will pick. Private-sector players will have to make a differential diagnostic: they will have to analyse where policy trajectories would fork, for the different solutions, and watch policy announcements for those forks, and only then, invest accordingly (or, depending on the distribution of potential gains and losses, they might invest partially in all possible optimal outcomes, until a policy decision makes at least one outcome non-optimal).\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the decarbonisation of electricity: it might be the case that in a current electricity market, neither PV, nor biomass, nor offshore wind, can compete with incumbents; but that with research funding and market reform, any one of them could be cheaper than either of the other two, and cheaper than the incumbents.  Let's say that the uncertainties around future costs, after economies of scale, mean that there is no significant difference in costs between a PV-dominant grid, a biomass-dominant grid, or an offshore-wind dominant grid; but that any of these is cheaper than a grid with no single dominant technology.\r\n\r\nNow, for the policy-maker in this scenario, there is nothing to choose between supporting PV, supporting biomass, or supporting offshore wind, all other things being equal. Which makes it impossible for the private sector to know where to invest.  Only when a long-term policy commitment is made that uniquely benefits one of the three, will the direction be certain."}

If margins are judged to be high for an industry (or group of companies) relative to their competitors, or to the proxy comparative industry, then some form of artificial pricing could be taking place.\r\n\r\nFiguring out where the difficulties are coming from can lead to creating \"[prisoner's dilemma][1]\" situations where the competition authorities offer an advantage to whoever breaks ranks in the cartel first.  If collusion is due to regulatory factors or some artificial advantage, then improving competition is going to be more difficult than simply fining a few companies.\r\n\r\nAs for unambiguous tests? No, which is why many cartels operate for years and then take years to investigate.  The European-wide vitamen cartel, [bust in 2001][2], took two years to investigate. A similar investigation for the [Pilkington-led glass cartel][3] ended in 2007. They're not easy to discover and, you'll note, these high profile cases would imply that only large-scale monopolies happen.  In my experience, such coercive pricing occurs at all levels, from small town key-cutters all agreeing to the same price, to industry-fixed prices through trade unions and artisans guilds.\r\n\r\nNote that it isn't always in government interests or ability to break up cartel-like behaviour (see OPEC, healthcare, public-sector unions, etc.).\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma\r\n  [2]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2001/nov/21/personalfinancenews.europeanunion\r\n  [3]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7116770.stm"}

And if we were starting with a *tabula rasa*, a blank slate, then that would be the right level too.\r\n\r\nHowever, such a tax (for example a carbon tax) is, in the real world, introduced into a market where capital investment has already taken place, leaving the market far from the equilibrium, and far from the optimal resource allocation that could be found if the externality had been internalised all along.\r\n\r\nThe marginal cost for incumbents will be lower than their average cost, in the short- to medium- term: they already have sunk costs, in their fixed asset base: factories, workforce skills, institutional structures. These incumbents with sunk costs slow down the move to a new equilibrium, and can act as a barrier-to-entry to disruptive new entrants who would otherwise catalyse the move to the new equilibrium.\r\n\r\nSo, if one didn't want to model all capital investments, but wanted a less data-intensive means of estimating the appropriate level of Pigouvian tax to minimise unnecessary damage and bring the market to new equilibrium in an orderly, but prompt manner, what information would be needed, to trade off the cost of stranded assets versus the cost of delay?"}

First, given the context of the question by @thepiachu, I assume the question is about about U.S. income inequality.  @Dimitris has written a good answer for the global situation, and I'll supplement it slightly with some U.S. data since it isn't clear whose income inequality the OP is concerned about.\r\n\r\nWe often measure inequality (of many types) using a Gini coefficient, and it is standard practice to report income inequality using this metric.  The metric is constructed so that it is equal to one if there is complete inequality (one person has/makes all the money), and zero if there is perfect equality (we all have/make the same amount of money).

First, given the context of the question by @thepiachu, I assume the question is about about U.S. income inequality.  @Dimitris has written a good answer for the global situation, and I'll supplement it slightly with some U.S. data since it isn't clear whose income inequality the OP is concerned about.\r\n\r\nWe often measure inequality (of many types) using a Gini coefficient, and it is standard practice to report income inequality using this metric.  The metric is constructed so that it is equal to one if there is complete inequality (one person has/makes all the money), and zero if there is perfect equality (we all have/make the same amount of money).

Removing some stock of a valuable thing from circulation will generally increase the value of the remaining circulating stock.\r\n\r\nRemoving currency from circulation will generally be deflationary: the price of goods, in that currency, will drop (and its exchange rate with other currencies will rise).\r\n\r\nIf prices drop so far that goods tend to cost more than a single unit of currency, then the currency ceases to be a medium of exchange, and other things will be used as substitute currency; and/or people revert to barter. Obviously, that could not happen with an infinitely divisble currency.\r\n\r\nHowver, by the time that deflation has happened so much that the divisibility becomes an issue, then there is a much much larger problem: the hoarders have now become nominally very rich (without having created any real wealth), and have the power to cause enormous disruption to that currency's economy. If the total amount of currency (or the proportion of currency that is hoarded) is known to only a very few market participants, then the currency is only viable as a store of value, insofar as the hoarders wish it to be: all other currency-users are playing a game with their wealth, blindfold. It's a financial russian roulette, where the biggest hoarders never have to put the gun to their heads, but all other market participants in that currency do. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the hoarders can exploit the market, by creating false scarcity to drive up the currency's exchange rate. In the right (wrong?) circumstances, this will create a bubble, that the hoarders can then sell into, removing lots of wealth from the rest of the market, and inflating the currency to near worthlessness - but they have will have very profitably dumped (most of) their hoarded currency before the bubble bursts."}

Without going into too many details (i.e. abstracting away from the formation of the demand curve these firms face), one result is essentially something you would expect. Compared with the version of the model in which everyone is a price-taker, firms optimally add a \"markup\" to the prices that they ask.

Many potential \"human capital\" investments can be both investments and consumption.  Further, human capital investments can include non-educational expenses, most notably health-related expenditures.\r\n\r\nWith that caveat in mind, let's consider the return to education while clearly acknowledging that we are assuming away other human capital investments that might be complements and/or substitutes.  \r\n\r\nWe tend to talk about under-investment in relative terms.  For example, whether we are sub-optimally investing in education depends on its return relative to that of physical capital.  So, we can simplify the question into something more easily answerable and ask: what is the return to education relative to the return to capital?  For example, from one of the more widely cited (but now a bit dated) papers on the subject by [Psachropoulous (1994)](http://sites.google.com/site/mavalfortwebpage/home/teaching/development-economics-psme-1/Psacharopoulos_1994.pdf):\r\n> The lowest  social  rate  of  return  average  referring  to  higher\r\n> education  in  OECD  countries  (8.7%)  is  close  to  the (long-term)\r\n> opportunity  cost  of  capital.  This  means  that  the  profitability\r\n> of  human  and  physical  capital,  at the  margin,  has  reached \r\n> virtual  equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe author found much higher rates of social return to education in Sub-Saharan Africa (~24% primary, 11.2% higher ed) and **private rates of return** that were even higher.   This is a clear signal that education is probably underinvested relative to capital.\r\n\r\nHowever, as you point out, we are (implicitly) ignoring the fact that in some cases, as [Ljungqvist (1993, p.220)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030438789390084Z) put it \"future  labor  earnings  cannot  serve as  collateral  on  a  loan.\"  As is common in development economics, whenever we see (especially private) returns to an activity or factor that are not in-line with returns to other activities/factors, we begin to think about missing or incomplete markets.  Here, we find that developing country credit markets are, for many people, missing (absent physical capital) hence the differential returns to education between high- and low-income countries."}

Namely, students using the former system seem to default at a much higher rate.  The article implies that this higher default rate is due to lower earnings (and less \"gainful employment\") among for-profit alumni.  It appears that policies may change to make it harder for students at some for-profit schools to get student loans.  There are hints that the policy change might include some sort of institutional outcomes test--namely that for-profit universities that do not provide income-enhancing education might not continue to host loans.  \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to provide an exact answer, but there are a couple of points I can make to think about the sorts of losses that might be implied by the defaults, and the consequences of the policy changes the defaults might inspire.\r\n\r\n - The trend may *reveal* something more important than the direct effect of defaults.  Namely, if we accept that education increases worker productivity, and that such productivity is reflected in wages, then the average graduate (exceptions noted) of these institutions is a less productive worker than the average graduate of a nonprofit or public institution.  Then, insofar as students who would otherwise have attended a traditional institution are diverted to these private institutions, the productivity of the workforce is decreased.  Some of these institutions are very large, and productivity losses accrue over the lifetime of their graduates.\r\n - Economists think about **private** and **social** returns to education.  The former is largely (but not entirely) reflected in increased wages.  The latter returns derive from a set of benefits thought to be derived indirectly from an educated populace.  It is the social returns that are often used justify public investment.  If students who attend the for-profit schools would not otherwise seek higher education, then there may be some social benefits lost from no longer supporting them.  The social benefits accrue over the lifetime of the students and beyond (due to inter-generational knowledge transfer within families).\r\n\r\n"}

So most typical cases of unemployment you can think of come under involuntary unemployment (the other common type is frictional unemployment, i.e., unemployment attributable to being 'between jobs').\r\n\r\nWhy is there such a huge debate about this? Believe it or not, until recently most prevailing models, being neo-classical in origin, assumed that unemployment is always voluntary. That is, if someone is not working it's because they do no want to work at the prevailing wage rate. The 2010 winners of the Nobel Prize, Diamond, Mortensen and Pissarides, are commonly credited with fixing these problems by making better employment search models.\r\n\r\nIn the quotation above, Keynes is probably saying that involuntary unemployment arises because the market takes time to adjust. suppose wage is w and the real wage is w/p. At this wage, some agents are willing to work but can't find work. Now if p rises, real wage falls, therefore demand for labour rises. This is why you get both surplus demand and supply of labour. As the market adjusts the surplus demand disappears. (Keynes would have contended that the supply of labour would continue to be in excess of the equilibrium level even in the long run though.)"}

This is what I know of LMC and SMC -- SMC is the slope of the short run total cost curve at a given point, while LMC is the slope of the long run total cost curve at a given point. To get the total cost from an average cost graph, we jut multiply by $Q;$ at the points of tangencies between LAC and ATC, thus total costs are the same. But is this sufficient to imply that the derivatives of total cost curves (short and long run) at this point are equal, and that thus SMC and LMC at this point are equal? I don't quite see it. Thanks!"}

Game is very easy to get into and doesn't take very long.\r\n\r\n - [Arkham Horror][2] - a game where if the players don't cooperate, they have very little chance of winning, but there are so many ways the players can cooperate, that it is hard to agree on the course of action to take. You have to work out a plan of action, but it is never clear until the very end if it will work or not, so people might prefer to not cooperate and work on their own plan. This is especially true with some of the expansion sets, that add more layers of incentives that quite often go against one another. It takes a bit to set up, understand and play, but can be a very rewarding game that will always provide a different challange.\r\n\r\n - [Battlestar Galactica][3] - a game of trust, betrayal and sacrificing self for the group (or vice versa). Every turn players have to decide whether they want to carry out actions that have direct, immediate returns, or save their resources to counter a possible \r\nfuture crisis. The main problem of the game is that some players are traitors and work against the other players, but at the same time they want to remain hidden and cause disputes between non-traitors. In order to win players have to figure out the motives other people have and whether they are doing what they are doing for the benefit of everyone, or not. Game takes a bit to understand, but the play is very rewarding (albeit quite often very heated) and is very re-playable.\r\n\r\n - [Cutthroat Caverns][4] - a game where \"without teamwork you will not survive, without betrayal, you will not win\". The players are cooperating to take down foes stronger than they are, but only the person to land the final blow will score any points. So you will have situations where first the players will be cooperating, only to start hindering one another not to let the other person get the reward. Similarly, other player can help you (by healing your character), but they will earn points for doing that, so you have to figure out what is more beneficial for you. You also have the economical choice of letting another player's character die so they won't win, but at the same time making the game harder for yourself. The game is easy to pick up and play, and is more light hearted than the other mentioned games.\r\n\r\nOther notable mentions are [A Game of Thrones][5] and [Shadow over Camelot][6], but most of what they offer have already been covered by the other mentioned games.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16772/mall-of-horror\r\n  [2]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror\r\n  [3]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111/battlestar-galactica\r\n  [4]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28259/cutthroat-caverns\r\n  [5]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6472/a-game-of-thrones\r\n  [6]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15062/shadows-over-camelot"}

I am trying to wrap my head around why the optimal production when there is no MC (it's =0) is at elasticity equal to -1 (unit elasticity), but here it's just the elastic part of the demand curve, without more precise specification. Is it because if we were at a given point on the elastic part of the demand curve, then decreasing price would increase quantity demanded (by a higher proportion in relation to price), but would also presumably drive the costs up, and since we don't know how those two balance out, we can't tell what, in general, would be preferred (unless we are given more data)?"}

They are useful in order to find closed-form solutions to consumer theory problems, and that's why they become important in practice. But to show that they are not necessary even to find closed-form solutions, consider lexicographical preferences (google it) - which satisfy axioms (1), (2) and (4).

Most merger analysis is necessarily predictive, requiring an assessment of what will likely happen if a merger proceeds as compared to what will likely happen if it does not. Given this inherent need for prediction, these Guidelines reflect the congressional intent that merger enforcement should interdict competitive problems in their incipiency and that certainty about anticompetitive effect is seldom possible and not required for a merger to be illegal.\r\n\r\nNB: The [FTC's statement on 'Unfairness'](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/policystmt/ad-unfair.htm) can shed light on the criteria for the consumer side of the market (correct and transparent information is key to the functioning of a competitive market)."}

This means that anyone's use of the good does not prevent others from also doing so, but they cannot be prevented from benefitting. Public goods are associated with **positive externalities** in a transaction. Because those who pay for public goods do not get the full benefit themselves, public goods are under consumed. Government is one way to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nThe classic example is street-lighting. Everyone benefits from being able to see at night, but each individual does not derive so much benefit that they would unilaterally spend a fortune to light the roads that they use most often. Assuming everyone thinks along the same lines, no street lights are ever installed, and everyone is worse off. Hence, a public good.\r\n\r\nStreet lighting would no loner be a public good if it were possible to charge users, for instance, if you could develop a pre-pay payment system for turning on street lights only as you walked past them.\r\n\r\nConsidering the existence of public goods is of particular relevance for the protection of the environment. Spending on technology to reduce CO2 emissions clearly falls within this category. National armed forces are also public goods.\r\n\r\nPublic goods are closely related to the free-rider problem, and have an impact both in over and under consumption. For instance, because the long-term potential costs of climate change are not contained within the supply price of electricity, the price is lower and hence the quantity higher than the social optimum. Conversely with street lighting, each individual's demand is lower than the overall demand (which would consider the sum of how useful everyone finds street lights), hence they are under-consumed."}

Obviously, the job market is segmented with people with certain in-demand skills able to leverage that when looking for a job, but I'm talking about the larger segment of the job market which does not include those people. Also, many of these factors slant the job market in favor of the employer even when unemployment is at normal levels.\r\n\r\nIs such a market operating efficiently? If not, what can be done to make it more efficient, hopefully to the benefit of both employers looking for new hires and people looking for jobs?"}

This means that anyone's use of the good does not prevent others from also doing so, but they cannot be prevented from benefitting. Public goods are associated with **positive externalities** in a transaction. Because those who pay for public goods do not get the full benefit themselves, public goods are under-produced. Government is one way to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nThe classic example is street-lighting. Everyone benefits from being able to see at night, but each individual does not derive so much benefit that they would unilaterally spend a fortune to light the roads that they use most often. Assuming everyone thinks along the same lines, no street lights are ever installed, and everyone is worse off. Hence, a public good.\r\n\r\nStreet lighting would no longer be a public good if it were possible to charge users, for instance, if you could develop a pre-pay payment system for turning on street lights only as you walked past them.\r\n\r\nConsidering the existence of public goods is of particular relevance for the protection of the environment. Spending on technology to reduce CO2 emissions clearly falls within this category. National armed forces are also public goods.\r\n\r\nPublic goods are closely related to the free-rider problem, and have an impact both in over and under consumption. For instance, because the long-term potential costs of climate change are not contained within the supply price of electricity, the price is lower and hence the quantity higher than the social optimum. Conversely with street lighting, each individual's demand is lower than the overall demand (which would consider the sum of how useful everyone finds street lights), hence they are under-consumed."}

They however never explain why. So my question is exactly this - suppose, Greece defaults, partially or completely, on its debts. I understand many Greek bondholders will be hurt - in whatever country they reside. But I seriously doubt whole euro economy is based on lending to Greece - whole Greece economy is mere 2.5% of eurozone. Is there another problem with this for every country that also uses euro and if so, what this problem is? Greece, as far as I understand, has no control over ECB policies and borrowing rates for the are market-based, so why would France, for example, care if nobody lends to Greece anymore and Greek economy collapses? Except for the usual problems with having collapsed country nearby (immigration, public order & safety, etc.) is there any direct economic consequences that would follow? I keep reading that this would \"undermine confidence in euro\" but I don't understand what that means - Greek debt is one thing and French one is another and German yet another, even if they are denominated in the same currency, why Greece defaulting would undermine confidence in Germany? \r\n\r\nCould anybody explain the mechanism of the consequences that could follow for other euro countries if any euro country defaults on its debt?"}

Particularly on the topic of non-rival goods, the items are often not perfectly non-rival. In fact, the definition of a public good is more theoretical than real. For example, focusing on the idea of street lamps, each lamp can only offer so much light. There is a point at which it starts to exclude. Even something as seemingly non-rival as oxygen does have a real measurable limit. \r\n\r\nThis is easily understandable when it comes to something such as an interstate. While traffic is low, the MC of one more driver is negligible, but traffic congestion has become a major issue. However, this imperfectness often leads to methods of properly allocating these goods.\r\n\r\nA large part of the importance in public goods comes from the research in efficiently supplying them. Without a method of offering them, we would all be worse off. However, if too much goes into supplying them, we can be worse off as well. \r\n\r\nA note about the facebook discussion above. The fact that we tend to be a product for facebook to sell should/could probably be viewed as a mechanism of charging for a public good. We collectively benefit from its existence, but charging for such websites has long been difficult. They have just found a method of doing so. However, one can use this type of public good to see some of the issues with it. There are sites that exist solely based on donation and voluntary payed memberships. There are also sites that have switched to payed memberships only. Doing the latter has often led to failure (e.g. the NY Times paywall), but voluntary memberships allow for free riding. None of these websites tend to be perfectly public and there are relatively obvious methods of charging for them, but doing so tends to have such negative effects that they are unsustainable... which circles back to them acting as public goods. For goods seen as non-essential, those best able to monetize are best able to survive, which makes them seem to be less of a public good. However, one should be careful not to forget that if the methods of monetizing the good fails, they will once again act as a public good. \r\n\r\nI feel this fact that many public goods are not perfect public goods is quite significant. Partially, because what happens at these margins as public goods become rival can have significant negative effects. Also, because discussing only theoretical perfect public goods ignores all of the goods that typically function as public goods. \r\n\r\nA final note on the importance of public goods via example. As stated, defense spending is often given as public. However, a major difficulty of public goods is deciding what amount of spending on a public good is optimal. For those who feel we are no safer with additional bombs an missiles, they see our current defense spending as wasteful and inefficient. However, others feel that we cannot possibly be safe enough and argue that defense spending must always be a priority since we all benefit so much from it."}

Basically, you have an auction in which everyone stands up initially. Once the auction starts, you state the starting bid (say 10 cents) and anyone who wants to continue vying for the dollar continues to stand, everyone else sits. And you keep increasing the bid every few seconds until you are left with only one person standing. The catch is this: the winner pays his/her final bid, and the second place finisher pays his/her final bid as well. Often, individuals will go well over the value of a dollar to win a bid and the auctioneer tends to turn a profit. You can increase these profits by requiring all players pay their final amount (thus those who sit down immediately are the only ones who pay zero). This demonstrates a few concepts: first, that the best strategy is to not play (the NE of the game, in fact) and also that of sunk costs. Although one only gains a dollar from winning, winning is always more beneficial than coming in second so one should ignore the fact that the bid is increasing because that money is already gone.\r\n\r\n[Swoopo][2] is a real life example of this game in action.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.frozensynapse.com/\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swoopo"}

But, the literature does provide some guidance.\r\n\r\nFor example, economists often try to elicit  people's willingness to pay for some good (often an environmental amenity).  Interestingly, we often find that their WTP for the amenity is less than what they are willing to accept to lose it (WTA).  We would expect the two measures to be about the same (see [Willig's famous 1974 AER paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1806699)).\r\n\r\nIndeed, WTA for a loss is almost always higher than WTP for the corresponding gain (see Table 1 in [Brown and Gregory (1999)](http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_1999_brown_t001.pdf) and, more famously, [Hanemann (1991)](http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v81y1991i3p635-47.html)). In general, there is an income effect with WTP questions that is not well-accounted for, while WTA answers often involve some risk aversion (that is, upsetting the status-quo).  There is a large literature here--in addition to what I've listed, see [Howowicz and McConnell](https://www.fnu.zmaw.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/courses/ere4_val/jeemhorowitzmcconnell.pdf).\r\n\r\nBut, the point is that how one words the question can be very important.  If the incentives are posed as a loss (e.g. payments NOT to do something your subjects already do) instead of as a gain (payments to do something that offsets a current behavior), you may get radically different results for people's estimates of what they might do given your proposed policy.  You might try finding a WTP (or, as applicable, WTA) equivalent to your incentives and see if you get different answers.\r\n"}

What are the conclusions? Please link some good papers to start with.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiemgauer"}

I'll try to justify this conclusion as I think it is an important point that is often lost in these discussions...\r\n\r\nIf we are talking about partial labor productivity (PFP) then it is usual to find that labor productivity increases with capital intensity.  Indeed, one of the most important drivers of European labor productivity growth has been changes in the labor participation rate; for example European labor participation fell between 1973 and '95 (apparently as a result of tax policy), causing capital substitution and, hence, relatively rapid increases in labor productivity (GDP per hour worked).  The opposite happened after 1995--labor productivity growth slowed (_even though labor quality was increasing_) due to labor market reforms aimed at increasing labor participation rates.  See van Ark et al. (2008, JEP 22(1)) for a good discussion along these lines.\r\n\r\nAnother  way to consider the same issue is to look at multi-factor productivity.  EU MFP growth decreased from about 1% in '70-95 to about 0.5% in '95-06.  As a result, labor productivity growth fell even though average worker skill levels were increasing (see O'Mahony et al. in _Innovation and Economic Development_ (Cimoli et al eds)).\r\n"}

One of those criteria is that they not default on their debt.  The EU is also supposed to help keep the economy of its member nations stable.  But the EU Constitution was never ratified so the only thing holding the EU together is the Treaties that say they agree to follow the rules set forth.  Because the constitution was never ratified there is teeth behind it.\r\n\r\nThose people investing on Greek debt today are speculating that either Greece will do something to right its ship, or that the EU will come along and bail them out.  Should the EU not bail out Greece and it is allowed to default and would eventually be severed from the union(unless it figures out how to right its ship in default on its own... I will cover bets for those who think that is possible)  then a precedence is set.  But there are several other countries that are not in as bad of shape as Greece primarily because the EU backs them.  The faith in their bonds would plummet.  Their credit would cost more and thus pushing them towards the state that Greece is in now.  Those countries that have would be inclined to pull away from those that do not to keep from being pulled down with them.  Assuming that Greece, Italy, and Spain are allowed to default, Germany pulls out rather than support so now the EU has lost its financially strongest member, Great Britain is already only a member in name and would probably pull out to save themselves.  The Euro would collapse as there is no country really backing it that can support itself let alone those once above marginal countries that have been drug down trying to save the rest... \r\n\r\nThis is only speculation of what would happen but it is what quite a few fear... probably rightly so.  Without the Euro the Chinese could take economic actions to devalue the dollar leaving them the only solid currency.  China does not have a history of being light footed with its power."}

The idea is roughly that given an income process (or technology process, depending on the question) an optimal nonlinear, intertemporal policy rule exists. Assume this rule can be approximated closely by a linear function. Agents would like to learn this policy rule, and a first pass is to have them learn the rule simply by experimentation. \"In autarky,\" i.e. without any information exchange with other agents, an agent would try a rule for some time, use some metric to determine how well it does against other rules he/she has tried, and perhaps reassess, perhaps try an entirely different rule via experimentation. This agent only observes his/her own history.\r\n\r\nA second pass is to allow the agent access to all other agents' histories. Presumably this would speed up learning. A third pass might be to put these agents on an information network of some sort. \r\n\r\nI've been perusing literature on social learning, but am not entirely sure the frameworks I am looking at are exactly what I want.

The three approaches are \"preferences,\" \"choice,\" and \"utility,\" and are often (hopefully) taught in the first section of a graduate-level core sequence in microeconomics. \r\n\r\nThese are in fact entirely separate theoretical models of how people think, but with some (arguably) minor assumptions, they can be shown to represent each other. Thus, if you find \"choice theory\" or \"preferences\" more intuitively appealing, if you accept some assumptions, they are entirely representable with a utility function. Of course, some of the interesting cases are when those concepts *aren't* equivalent.\r\n\r\nA very nice overview of these three approaches can be found in the first three chapters of Ariel Rubinstein's absolutely free grad-level microeconomics textbook, posted on his website [here][1].

How exactly step-by-step does this work mechanistically?  Below is my guess of how this works; please confirm or revise it.\r\n\r\nLet's say that Japan decides they want to sell 1B yen in exchange for dollars in order to help exporters.  So the BOJ creates out of thin air (electronically) 1B yen and transfers it into some persons account in exchange for a reciprocal transfer of dollars to BOJ's account.  Does the BOJ do this entirely self-sufficiently, or do they require a middle man transaction with the Japanese Treasury?  If so, how exactly does this middle man transaction work?\r\n\r\nOK, so far so good.  Japan has removed dollars from circulation and added yen to circulation therefore causing depreciation of the yen.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't understand is that BOJ will not just want to sit on these dollars.  They will want to purchase US Treasury Bonds in order to achieve some rate of return which subsequently places the dollars back in circulation.  I guess the 1B yen is still in circulation and so some depreciation has occurred.  Is this correct?"}

If their formulation of policy choice really does imply that there is always a unique, knowable solution, then their model is not useful for cases where we can demonstrate that there is *not* a unique knowable solution.\r\n\r\nIt's not difficult to construct a set of scenarios where the optimal policy problem has several solutions, or at least, one where the uncertainties swamp the expected welfare differences between solutions, so that there is no *significant* difference in total expected welfare between solutions. \r\n\r\nAnd so, to answer the direct question: in such cases as above, the private sector *cannot* know which optimal policy the central planner will pick. Private-sector players will have to make a differential diagnostic: they will have to analyse where policy trajectories would fork, for the different solutions, and watch policy announcements for those forks, and only then, invest accordingly (or, depending on the distribution of potential gains and losses, they might invest partially in all possible optimal outcomes, until a policy decision makes at least one outcome non-optimal).\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the decarbonisation of electricity: it might be the case that in a current electricity market, neither PV, nor biomass, nor offshore wind, can compete with incumbents; but that with research funding and market reform, any one of them could be cheaper than either of the other two, and cheaper than the incumbents.  Let's say that the uncertainties around future costs, after economies of scale, mean that there is no significant difference in costs between a PV-dominant grid, a biomass-dominant grid, or an offshore-wind dominant grid; but that any of these is cheaper than a grid with no single dominant technology.\r\n\r\nNow, for the policy-maker in this scenario, there is nothing to choose between supporting PV, supporting biomass, or supporting offshore wind, all other things being equal. Which makes it impossible for the private sector to know where to invest.  Only when a long-term policy commitment (one that the market can trust) is made that uniquely benefits one of the three, will the direction be certain."}

For example, if the market thinks that the central bank will raise the interest rate in the future, inflation expectations today will be lowered and the market will be affected. To solve this, it is assumed that the private sector knows that the social planner will optimize at each time, and can thus form its expectations accordingly. Through some clever manipulations, Svensson and Woodford are able to reduce the problem of optimal policy to solving for the Kalman gain matrix.\r\n\r\nThey derive the formula $$K =PL'(LPL'+\\Sigma_{vv})^{-1}$$ where P in turn can be solved for from $$P = H(P-PL'(LPL'+\\Sigma_{vv})^{-1}LP)H'+\\Sigma_{uu}$$\r\n\r\nNever mind the exact expression (if you are interested, the definitions of all the symbols are all in the paper). However, it is not a priori obvious that the above equation has a unique solution (and I believe I know of cases when this does indeed have several legitimate solutions).\r\n\r\nMy question is as follows:\r\nIf it is true that the optimal policy problem has several solutions, and the private sector forms its opinions based on the assumption of optimal policy, how does the private sector know which optimal policy the central planner will pick?\r\n\r\nCaveat: I am not a trained economist.

Tutors are selling their time in exchange for an hourly wage.  If the market for tutors is perfectly competitive, then the typical argument will show that tutors will be paid the value their marginal product (VMP).  We could show that a more productive tutor will earn a higher wage, and therefore that setting an upper bound on tutor pay will distort the market.  In that sense, the question is similar to a previous question:  [What are some general economic principles that guide CEO pay?](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/299/what-are-some-general-economic-principles-that-guide-ceo-pay)\r\n\r\nBut, a difficulty arises when we ask what, exactly, is the value marginal product of a tutor?  Let's assume that students hire a tutor in order to increase their grades.  Under this assumption, a better tutor--one that is more productive at increasing grades--will command a higher wage.  But, it is not at all clear how to convert the tutor's \"grade productivity\" into a VMP, and hence a wage.  That we don't really know how students optimize their study time, or how they go about valuing grades, is evidenced by the response to another question on this site:  [Do Students Exhibit Rational Behavior in Determining Study Time?](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/140/do-students-exhibit-rational-behavior-in-determining-study-time)\r\n\r\nLet's assume that students can determine how much they are willing to pay for tutoring that will increase their grade by a certain amount (big assumption).  Then, if students understand how much the tutor can help them, they can form an accurate willingness to pay for tutoring.  Tutors, due to their experience, are likely to be able to fairly accurately predict just how much they will be able to help a student.  But the student might not.  If that is the case, then the tutor has more information than the student.  Perfect competition can break down under information asymmetry (see again [the question on CEO pay](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/299/what-are-some-general-economic-principles-that-guide-ceo-pay)).  The wage cap might be an attempt to adjust for this asymmetry.\r\n\r\nPerfect competition might break down in other ways too.  For example, suppose that for a given course there are only a few available tutors to serve many students.  In this case, the tutors can set a wage that is higher than their VMP (however that is assessed).  While the transaction is still voluntary (and hence mutually beneficial), the tutors would be using their market power to take more of the [consumer surplus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_surplus) than they could under a competitive market.  The standard argument is that these high wages will induce more qualified people to become tutors, and that the increased supply would eventually decrease the wage.  \r\n\r\nBut, I assume that there are barriers to entry to becoming a tutor who is officially listed by the university.  Thus, it might be difficult for qualified people to become \"official\" tutors in response to the high wages.  If this is the case, one possible argument in favor of the cap is that the university wants to prevent providing an indirect subsidy to tutors just by listing them as an official tutor for a course. \r\n\r\nFinally, the university may be reasoning that the tutors are using university resources (desks, chalkboards, meeting spaces, student registries) in furtherance of their business, and that the students have already paid for these resources.  They may view the wage ceiling as a market correction to internalize the cost of using university resources.  This is a very common argument among university administrators (e.g. in limiting vending prices), and, while I know nothing about the case at hand, seems to be the most likely case.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the cap is desirable is outside the domain of economics--at best, we can state that it _might_ correct some market imperfections.  We'd have to know exactly what the university's policy objective is in order to assess the policy (see http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/416/why-cant-or-shouldnt-economists-answer-normative-questions).\r\n\r\n"}

That we don't really know how students optimize their study time, or how they go about valuing grades, is evidenced by the response to another question on this site:  [Do Students Exhibit Rational Behavior in Determining Study Time?](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/140/do-students-exhibit-rational-behavior-in-determining-study-time) \r\n\r\nLet's assume that students can determine how much they are willing to pay for tutoring that will increase their grade by a certain amount (big assumption).  Then, if students understand how much the tutor can help them, they can form an accurate willingness to pay for tutoring.  Tutors, due to their experience, are likely to be able to fairly accurately predict just how much they will be able to help a student.  But the student might not.  If that is the case, then the tutor has more information than the student.  Perfect competition can break down under information asymmetry (see again [the question on CEO pay](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/299/what-are-some-general-economic-principles-that-guide-ceo-pay)).  The wage cap might be an attempt to adjust for this asymmetry.\r\n\r\nPerfect competition might break down in other ways too.  For example, suppose that for a given course there are only a few available tutors to serve many students.  In this case, the tutors can set a wage that is higher than their VMP (however that is assessed).  While the transaction is still voluntary (and hence mutually beneficial), the tutors would be using their market power to take more of the [consumer surplus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_surplus) than they could under a competitive market.  The standard argument is that these high wages will induce more qualified people to become tutors, and that the increased supply would eventually decrease the wage.  \r\n\r\nBut, I assume that there are barriers to entry to becoming a tutor who is officially listed by the university.  Thus, it might be difficult for qualified people to become \"official\" tutors in response to the high wages.  If this is the case, one possible argument in favor of the cap is that the university wants to prevent providing an indirect subsidy to tutors just by listing them as an official tutor for a course. \r\n\r\nFinally, the university may be reasoning that the tutors are using university resources (desks, chalkboards, meeting spaces, student registries) in furtherance of their business, and that the students have already paid for these resources.  They may view the wage ceiling as a market correction to internalize the cost of using university resources.  This is a very common argument among university administrators (e.g. in limiting vending prices), and, while I know nothing about the case at hand, seems to be the most likely case.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the cap is desirable is outside the domain of economics--at best, we can state that it _might_ correct some market imperfections.  We'd have to know exactly what the university's policy objective is in order to assess the policy (see http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/416/why-cant-or-shouldnt-economists-answer-normative-questions).\r\n\r\n"}

In such a situation the central bank might be *forced* to print currency and make deflationary meassures impossible.

If the market for tutors is perfectly competitive, then the typical argument will show that tutors will be paid the value their marginal product (VMP).  We could show that a more productive tutor will earn a higher wage, and therefore that setting an upper bound on tutor pay will distort the market.  In that sense, the question is similar to a previous question:  [What are some general economic principles that guide CEO pay?](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/299/what-are-some-general-economic-principles-that-guide-ceo-pay)\r\n\r\nBut, a difficulty arises when we ask what, exactly, is the value marginal product of a tutor?  Let's assume that students hire a tutor in order to increase their grades.  Under this assumption, a better tutor--one that is more productive at increasing grades--will command a higher wage.  But, it is not at all clear how to convert the tutor's \"grade productivity\" into a VMP, and hence a wage.  That we don't really know how students optimize their study time, or how they go about valuing grades, is evidenced by the response to another question on this site:  [Do Students Exhibit Rational Behavior in Determining Study Time?](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/140/do-students-exhibit-rational-behavior-in-determining-study-time) \r\n\r\nLet's assume that students can determine how much they are willing to pay for tutoring that will increase their grade by a certain amount (big assumption).  Then, if students understand how much the tutor can help them, they can form an accurate willingness to pay for tutoring.  Tutors, due to their experience, are likely to be able to fairly accurately predict just how much they will be able to help a student.  But the student might not.  If that is the case, then the tutor has more information than the student.  Perfect competition can break down under information asymmetry (see again [the question on CEO pay](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/299/what-are-some-general-economic-principles-that-guide-ceo-pay)).  The wage cap might be an attempt to adjust for this asymmetry.\r\n\r\nPerfect competition might break down in other ways too.  For example, suppose that for a given course there are only a few available tutors to serve many students.  In this case, the tutors can set a wage that is higher than their VMP (however that is assessed).  While the transaction is still voluntary (and hence mutually beneficial), the tutors would be using their market power to take more of the [consumer surplus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_surplus) than they could under a competitive market.  The standard argument is that these high wages will induce more qualified people to become tutors, and that the increased supply would eventually decrease the wage.  \r\n\r\nBut, I assume that there are barriers to entry to becoming a tutor who is officially listed by the university.  Thus, it might be difficult for qualified people to become \"official\" tutors in response to the high wages.  If this is the case, one possible argument in favor of the cap is that the university wants to prevent providing an indirect subsidy to tutors just by listing them as an official tutor for a course. \r\n\r\nFinally, the university may be reasoning that the tutors are using university resources (desks, chalkboards, meeting spaces, student registries) in furtherance of their business, and that the students have already paid for these resources.  They may view the wage ceiling as a market correction to internalize the cost of using university resources.  This is a very common argument among university administrators (e.g. in limiting vending prices), and, while I know nothing about the case at hand, seems to be the most likely case.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the cap is desirable is outside the domain of economics--at best, we can state that it _might_ correct some market imperfections.  We'd have to know exactly what the university's policy objective is in order to assess the policy (see http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/416/why-cant-or-shouldnt-economists-answer-normative-questions).\r\n\r\n"}

Whatever they did that allowed them to become wealthy (be it a new process, factory, retail chain or the like) benefits us directly through the jobs and products they bring to the market;\r\n2. The profits they generate are returned to the market through both taxes and where they invest their after-tax profits (usually in equities which permits other companies to create new wealth);\r\n\r\nThese benefits give the wealthy a rather disproportionate impact on the economy.  As one example, the wealthiest 1% contribute about 20-30% of all income tax and about 8-10% of all tax raised by the state (in the US, UK and EU).\r\n\r\nThis also means that volatility in the incomes of the super wealthy create equally disproportionate volatility in state earnings and tax revenue.\r\n\r\nCapping the amount that the wealthy are allowed to earn removes all the benefits since it reduces not only the incentive but also the ability to invest.  Taxes would, therefore, have to rise for all, economies would become less competitive (since economies of scale are removed) and the likelihood is that many of the these people would simply emigrate, taking their know-how with them.\r\n\r\nIndia, by way of example, has already tried this (see [License Raj][1]).  Believing in the [Lump of Labour Fallacy][2], they limited the number of products companies could produce or export (bicycles were a favourite) so that, despite India's advantage in labour, they couldn't bring it to bare.  This didn't stop the rich getting richer, but it certainly stopped the poor getting richer.\r\n\r\nWhat happened is that China opened up faster than India and, by the time India started the process of legislative rationalisation, China's economy had already become the centre of mass production.\r\n\r\nThe impact of capping the earnings of the wealthy will end up hurting everyone else far more than it hurts the rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_Raj\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy"}

Why $0.00 Is the Future of Business][4]) and is a viable and effective business strategy.\r\n\r\nCompanies are unable to sustain a loss-leader (or a \"dumped\" trade) for very long as it destroys their capital.  The only reason to do so is if it creates an advantage in selling other products.  As you identify, dive shops offer low-cost tank fills in order to drive sales of high-priced equipment much as did King Gillette did with his razer handles in order to sell blades.  That works as long as no-one offers blades as a loss-leader, or massively cuts margins on high-priced dive equipment and ruins the pricing strategy.\r\n\r\nTo rephrase your question for the general case, *what happens when one company's critical profit-driving products are selected as another company's loss-leaders* (or, more reasonably, their optimised main products)?  For instance:\r\n\r\n - Music companies losing the sale of profit-generating albums to low-cost singles and digital downloads to other company's high-priced portable media devices;\r\n - Printer companies losing out on high-priced cartridge refills to low-priced mass-producers;\r\n - Supermarkets selling cheap insurance based on learning from customer's purchasing preferences via their instore cards what their risk profile is;\r\n\r\nThere are strategies which companies can adopt to counter the undermining of their primary income source:\r\n\r\n - IBM discarded their personal computer business and took the risk of focusing on consulting;\r\n - Nokia abandoned its roots in rubber, wood and cable to specialise in mobile phones;\r\n\r\nIn a slow-moving market companies will adopt different **[pricing strategies][5]** in order to adapt to changes in competitor practice.  However, where change happens rapidly then it leads to **[disruptive innovation][6]** which may happen too quickly for adaption, or from an unseen market area.  HP, for instance, may have waited too long to adapt their strategy to changing market conditions.\r\n\r\nI would imagine, however, that some of your SCUBA shops will experiment with alternative models and the winners will then move into the spots vacated by their less adaptable counterparts.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_%28pricing_policy%29\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing\r\n  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader\r\n  [4]: http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-03/ff_free?currentPage=all\r\n  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing_strategies\r\n  [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology"}

Is it only the wealthy of that particular country?\r\n\r\nAccording to the Federal Reserve of New York (in a release from 2007, i.e. just before the current crisis):\r\n\r\n> The investor class data show that dealers and brokers alone account\r\n> for 75.4 percent of Treasury securities sold to the public, on\r\n> average. Foreign and international investors account for the next\r\n> largest share, 12.5 percent, followed by investment funds (6.5\r\n> percent), depository institutions (0.5 percent), individuals (0.5\r\n> percent), and private pension and retirement funds and insurance\r\n> companies (0.0 percent). \u201cOther\u201d investors, not captured in any of the\r\n> classes cited, accounted for 4.6 percent of the Treasury securities\r\n> sold to the public. Again, there is significant variation in purchase\r\n> shares across auctions, with depository institutions buying as much as\r\n> 31.6 percent of an issue, investment funds buying 46.1 percent of an issue, and foreign and international investors buying 38.6 percent of\r\n> an issue.\r\n\r\nThe last is important: 31.6% are depositary organisations (i.e. retail banks), 46.1% are investment funds (i.e. everything from investment banks to insurance companies) and 38.6% are international investors (i.e. sovereign wealth funds and foreign investment funds).\r\n\r\nIn other words, anyone who has a bank account, insurance policy or pension is involved in purchasing government bonds - not just the \"wealthy\".\r\n\r\nNext, [how bonds work][1].  They're a loan.  Governments claim that they can invest this money to drive greater economic growth or support social goods which will reduce risk on economic stability.  Governments borrow based on the assumption that the investment will be worth more than the future cost of borrowing.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for money today, investors ask for a return for taking on risk of default and the opportunity cost of not using that money elsewhere.  So it is a trade and both parties should benefit from it.\r\n\r\nIf the government fails to invest that money wisely then, certainly, the investor may come out of it better-off than the borrower (as long as the borrower doesn't default).\r\n\r\nHowever, the reason that bonds are considered such a \"safe\" investment is that the lender / investor is also a taxpayer.  Government can nominally raise taxes on everyone to cover its debt to those self-same taxpayers.  Not only the wealthy and workers, but everyone is both borrower and lender (government borrows money from the people and then pays the people back with money it generates by taxing the people).\r\n\r\nThe fly in the ointment is foreign investors who cannot be taxed directly.  Unfortunately, they can be taxed through trade tariffs.  As debt becomes unsupportable the drive to raise trade tariffs is growing.\r\n\r\nAs should be clear: governments have the upper-hand in bond negotiations; they can raise taxes or tariffs, debase their currency, or simply default.  Investors can only hope for the return they were originally promised.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.moneyweek.com/investments/what-should-you-expect-if-you-invest-in-bonds"}

I think it is likely that for the larger part of this group, Government transfers are above their taxes paid on VAT. Insofar interest payments to the gain of bondholders most likely come from the upper half of the income distribution. Around 50% of income taxes and likely more than 50% of capital gains taxes come from the highest 10% of incomes. \r\n\r\nDefining this upper 10% as \"the rich\" and the 50%-90% incomes as middle class, we can stack this house of cards a bit higher, and look at two cases: \r\n\r\n1. In the first case, only the rich hold bonds. In this case half the interest rates are payed by the rich and half are payed by the middle class, and we have redistribution from the middle class to the rich. \r\n\r\n2. In this case, bonds are spread evenly among the upper half of the income distribution. With interest payments having the same sources as in the first case, 80% of them go to the middle class and 20% to the rich. In this case the redistribution is from the rich to the middle classes. \r\n\r\nWhat should become clear is that any redistributional effects depend on the distribution of the bonds in the population (directly or indirectly through investment vehicles), and certainly are not uniform within the income groups (a person living off an endowment in the middle class may profit, a person with a high income from the job may suffer, even if the average effect for the groups may be reversed).

The prof had a habit of giving out general questions, and we had to come up with all of the assumptions needed to make the problem workable.   Since this looks like a homework problem, I'll answer in general: \r\n\r\nYou can get pretty far by making some simplifying assumptions:\r\n\r\n - you derive constant known utility per unit time from having a car (ANY working car) or\r\n - you'd have to rent a car at some rate per day if you didn't own one\r\n\r\nand that\r\n\r\n - maintenance cost, \r\n - the market value of the car, and\r\n - the probability of major breakdown (incurring a known cost of repair)\r\n\r\nare known functions of the age of the car (implicitly, the condition of the car is a function of its age).  The last assumption makes this a stochastic problem.\r\n\r\nThen you find a buy date to maximize the expected PV of the net benefit stream.  How specific you can get depends on how much of the various functions you are able to specify (or how much you are willing to hold your nose and write them down) and you can make the problem more fun by adding more detail.\r\n\r\nYou can find similar examples in many dynamic optimization books (although they may not be about cars). \r\n\r\nNote that your (implicit) assumption that new cars aren't ever worth it has been questioned, see e.g. [Akerlof's (1970)](http://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/qjecon/v84y1970i3p488-500.html) famous paper and the piles of articles that came after it."}

The Fed swaps dollars for the foreign currency, and then effectively owns the foreign currency, having given up the dollars at a set exchange rate.  i.e. the Fed becomes exposed to foreign currency risk, and other than the arrangement having been made between two central banks, this is effectively a \"trade\" and the Fed can gain or lose from it.\r\n\r\n 2. The Fed swaps dollars for the foreign currency, and there is an agreement that the swap will be closed at some later date (a set date, or an open date?) through some kind of compensating transaction to undo the original amounts swapped.  i.e. the Fed is *not* exposed to foreign currency risk and won't gain or lose through fluctuation in the foreign currency.  Isn't there still some kind of counterparty risk here, e.g. sovereign default?\r\n\r\nEssentially, I'm trying to better understand what kind of exposure the Fed takes on when providing these \"swap lines\", and how it may benefit the Fed other than simply providing liquidity to the international market.

So I'll call it the White Swan Strategy, as a nod to Taleb. I'll update this intro if someone gives me the formal name.\r\n\r\nThe White Swan Strategy aims to make long-term profits through accruing lots of small incremental wins. The challenge it faces is that the actions required to obtain the small wins usually involves paring away resilience; and that sooner or later, an event that was otherwise considered extremely unlikely or impossible (the Black Swan) comes along, and because of the reduced resilience, large one-off losses are made. Three things make the White Swan Strategy exciting:\r\n\r\n 1. It's very difficult to estimate the cost of the Black Swan, in advance; \r\n 2. It's very difficult to estimate the probability of the Black Swan, in advance; and\r\n 3. Humans are very bad at weighing up the significance of extremely small probabilities.\r\n\r\nAnd that makes it a very big gamble as to whether or not the accumulation of lots of small incremental wins outweighs the rare large loss. The White Swan Strategy is a high-stakes game where no one is quite sure of the odds.\r\n\r\nJust-in-time manufacturing is a White Swan Strategy: incremental cost savings are made through potential fast flexibility of choice of supplier, reduced costs of holding stock, and reduced losses from expired stock. All this comes at a risk of a sudden spike in costs: any delay in the supply chain, means that customers won't get their goods.\r\n\r\nGeographic agglomeration can also result in a White Swan Strategy: it enables lots of smaller producers to take advantage of some network effects and some economies of scale that would otherwise be unavailable to them. And those cost savings get passed on to their customers. However, if those customers choose to let the small cost savings outweigh the risks of lack of geographical diversity in their supply base, then they'll make lots of small cost savings over time, but if any geography-specific event happens (such as the Thai floods), then the lack of supply-chain resilience will turn into a sudden spike in costs.\r\n\r\nAdded to those White-Swan-Strategy effects, there's also a potential degradation of the Commons going on: anthropogenic releases of greenhouse gases cause changes in climate; but all our manufacturing (as well as habitation and farming) is predicated on the climate as it was throughout the twentieth century. Which means that climate changes can change formerly cost-optimal location decisions to become very sub-optimal.  Events such as the Thai floods will become more common, and although we cannot say for certain which extreme-weather event was or was not the result of human-caused climate change, we do know that the frequency of those will increase.\r\n\r\nAs usual with these degradation of the Commons, we reach an aggregate state that is very sub-optimal, even though it was the result of the accumulation of individually-optimal decisions."}

For instance, if I'm a world expert in Auction Theory (i'm not!), I could answer auction theory questions that people have and then have it \"paid back\" by earning credits which I could use to have world experts in econometrics answer my questions.

The idea is that a decision maker is represented by a multitude of 'selves' your actions now determine what self you will become and this self then becomes a decision maker itself. Commonly, this is modeled now as a game between selves. For finite time horizon problems, an axiomatic characterization of the behavior in the multiple-self in terms of preferences over certain decision problems has been given by Gul und Pesendorfer (2005, REStud). The multiple-self model has certain pathological feautures related to the possible non-uniqueness of the equilibrium in the game between the selves, as documented in a note by Vielle and Weibull (Economic Theory, 2009).  \r\n\r\nA way of modeling changing tastes that is still somewhat popular in applied work goes back to Becker and Stigler (AER, 1977). They basicall treat the individual as having fixed preferences but changing the technology of enjoying consumer products. If you drink more wine, you become better at enjoying it. So their theory is really a theory of unchanging prefernces, designed to accomodate phenomena associated with changing preferences. \r\n"}

Further suppose without loss of generality that Good A's MU/$ was higher than Good B's.

Therefore, the consumer could not have been at the optimum in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it's a bit of a tautology: If the consumer is optimizing (e.g. ensuring that they could not spend their last dollar any differently without reducing their total utility) then the marginal utilities over all goods must be equal.\r\n\r\nDiminishing marginal utilities work nicely in this world, as they mean that you won't keep consuming more of Good A until your whole budget is exhausted--at some point the utility will drop below that of other goods and you'll stop spending money on A.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that the book's sentence would be more clearly stated \"for **every** product.\"  That takes us into a many-good world, and the results generalize.\r\n\r\n"}

Agents would like to learn this policy rule, and a first pass is to have them learn the rule simply by experimentation. \"In autarky,\" i.e. without any information exchange with other agents, an agent would try a rule for some time, use some metric to determine how well it does against other rules he/she has tried, and perhaps reassess, perhaps try an entirely different rule via experimentation.

To get the total cost from an average cost graph, we jut multiply by $Q;$ at the points of tangencies between LAC and ATC, thus total costs are the same.

Now, the individual ATC curves are short run average cost curves for different levels of output.  \r\n\r\nFirms are more constrained in the short run, so therefore may be forced to produce a non-optimal output. For any given level of output, the lowest possible cost is that which is achievable in the long run. So, to produce $Q_1$ in the short run, the firm will find itself on $ATC_1$.  The lowest possible (minimum) average cost in the short run provides one point on the long run curve.\r\n\r\nGiven an infinity of output quantities, we can trace a continuous LAC curve by tracing these minimum points on the ATC curves (only three such points are shown in the chart).  So, LAC is showing the lowest cost for each level of output, not input ratios.\r\n\r\nTo see why the LRMC curve intersects LAC at it's minimum, consider that $LAC = C(Q)/Q$ so that at its minimum we have (by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero): $$C'(Q)/Q=C(Q)/Q^2 \\implies C'(Q)=C(Q)/Q ~ or ~ MC=AC$$\r\n\r\nThis leaves a final question:  why don't the individual SMC curves intersect the corresponding ATC curves at their minimums?

Here is an excerpt from the talk:\r\n\r\n> Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just\r\n> the poor who are affected by inequality. There seems to be some truth\r\n> in John Donne's \"No man is an island.\" And in a number of studies,\r\n> it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal\r\n> countries at each level in the social hierarchy. This is just one\r\n> example. It's infant mortality. Some Swedes very kindly classified a\r\n> lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of\r\n> general socioeconomic classification. And so it's anachronistically a\r\n> classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their\r\n> own. But then where it says \"low social class,\" that's unskilled\r\n> manual occupations. It goes through towards the skilled manual\r\n> occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high\r\n> to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of\r\n> larger companies.\r\n> \r\n> You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across\r\n> the social hierarchy. The biggest differences are at the bottom of\r\n> society. But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to\r\n> being in a more equal society. We show that on about five different\r\n> sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United\r\n> States and internationally. And that seems to be the general picture\r\n> -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.\r\n\r\nThus, that there might be a *negative* effect on the upper-class' well-being from inequality.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have to write a paper on exactly this question, i.e. does inequality have a negative effect on the (upper-class') well-being.\r\n\r\nMy question: what are good sources on this subject? For instance, the TED talks mentions a few other studies that support him, and mentions there is also criticism on his findings - both of which I cannot find.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson.html"}

Below is an actual announcement issued by the treasury department that it will be having an auction to raise \\$23 billion.\r\n![enter image description here][4]\r\n\r\nThe announcement indicates the date of the auction (March 8th, 2011 in the example) as well as deadlines for competitive (11:30 AM) and noncompetitive (11:00 AM) bids. If you would like to participate in the auction then your bids must be submitted before these times.\r\n\r\n**Competitive Bid** - the bidder specifies the maximum price they will pay for the security. All treasuries are priced in \\$100 so bids are submitted in terms of buying a security that will repay the owner \\$100 when the security matures (\\$100 is the face or par value).\r\n\r\n**Noncompetitive Bid** - the bidder does not specify any maximum price requirement. These bidders are first in line to be issued a bill but they will get whatever price is determined at auction.\r\n\r\nThere is a limit of \\$5 million that can be submitted as a noncompetitive bid per bidder per auction.\r\n\r\nFor competitive bids any one customer can be awarded a maximum of 35% of the total offering.\r\n\r\nIn order to better illustrate the mechanics of the auction let's go back to the example. The table below is a hypothetical list of bids for the \\$23 billion being issued. The bids include the total amount the bidder is willing to purchase as well as the maximum price the bidder will pay based on a \\$100 par value note.\r\n\r\nBid 1: \\$5 billion, max price: don't care (noncompete)<br>\r\nBid 2: \\$10 billion, max price: don't care (noncompete)<br>\r\nBid 3: \\$5 billion, max price: \\$98<br>\r\nBid 4: \\$5 billion, max price: \\$95<br>\r\nBid 5: \\$10 billion, max price: \\$92<br>\r\nBid 6: \\$5 billion, max price: \\$90<br>\r\n\r\nNotice there is a total of \\$40 billion in bids. The auction is only for \\$23 billion. This means some bids will go unfilled. The ratio between bids and the amount of the auction is called the bid-to-cover ration. For our example it is 1.74 (\\$40/\\$23). A high bid-to-cover ratio indicates a strong demand for the bonds since there are a lot of bidders. A low ratio indicates weak demand. A ratio under 2.0 is considered weak.\r\n\r\nThe bids are filled in the following manner:\r\n\r\n 1. All the noncompetitive bids are filled first. This means Bid 1 and Bid 2 will be filled first. This fills \\$15 of the \\$23 billion leaving \\$8 billion left. \r\n 2. Once all the noncompetitive bids are filled then the competitive bids are filled next starting from the highest max price and proceeding to the lowest until the issue is completely fulfilled.  This means Bid 3 will be filled in full. The remaining \\$3 billion will be issued to Bid 4. For this auction Bid 5 and Bid 6 will go unfilled.\r\n 3. Since Bid 4 was the last accepted competitive bid, its max price will be the price that **all** (both competitive and noncompetitive) bidders will receive. This price will also determine the yield for this auction which is 5.26% (100-95/95 * 100).\r\n\r\nResults of our example auction:\r\n\r\nBid 1: \\$5 billion, max price: noncompetitive, **All \\$5 billion filled at \\$95**<br>\r\nBid 2: \\$10 billion, max price: noncompetitive, **All \\$10 billion filled at \\$95**<br>\r\nBid 3: \\$5 billion, max price: \\$98, **All \\$5 billion filled at \\$95**<br>\r\nBid 4: \\$5 billion, max price: \\$95, **Only \\$3 billion filled at \\$95**<br>\r\nBid 5: \\$10 billion, max price: \\$92, **Not filled**<br>\r\nBid 6: \\$5 billion, max price: \\$90, **Not filled**<br>\r\n\r\nOnce the auction is completed the treasury will post the results of the auction. Below is the actual results of the auction.\r\n![enter image description here][5]\r\n\r\nThere are some additional items that are reported from the auction:<br>\r\n**High Rate:** This is the highest yield (or the lowest price) that was accepted at the auction. For our example this would be \\$95.<br>\r\n**Allotted at High:** This is the percentage of the total that was filled at the highest accepted yield (or lowest accepted price). For our example, the last \\$3 billion we filled was at the lowest price so our allotment at high would be \\$3/\\$23 = 13%.<br>\r\n**Price:** Price as determined by the auction.<br>\r\n**Median Rate:** Half of the competitive bids were submitted below this rate while the other half were above.<br>\r\n**Low Rate:** The lowest yield (or highest price) submitted for the competitive bids.\r\n\r\nThe announcement also shows the breakdown of the amount of bids submitted noncompetitively versus competitively and how much was rewarded for those same categories.\r\n\r\nThere is an entry in the middle of the results announcement listed as SOMA. This stands for System Open Market Account. This represents treasuries that are held by the Federal Reserve. If the Federal Reserve has treasuries that are maturing then it is expected that they will use the proceeds from those maturing treasuries to buy new treasuries. For our example auction the FED had no bills maturing at the time. If they did then the FED would also get the same price determined at the auction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://economics.stackexchange.com/users/165/muro\r\n  [2]: http://money.stackexchange.com/users/1229/muro\r\n  [3]: http://money.stackexchange.com/q/2907\r\n  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bq1j7.jpg\r\n  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zl4Lp.jpg"}

That seems implausibly straightforward.\r\n - It just means that Greece would no longer be able to sit at eurozone meetings. In this case what would stop Greece from continuing to use the euro as its currency unilaterally, like a number of other unofficial eurozone members (for example, Kosovo and Montenegro)?\r\n - It really means that Greece could indeed continue to use whatever currency it wanted, but in reality it would \"obviously\" ditch the euro in order to cheapen its exports.\r\n\r\nI have read widely on this subject, but no one asks or answers this question.

However, it is possible to \"store\" up demand (and supply) if the price-point that would trigger conversion to trade is unmatched.\r\n\r\nThe buyer has demand for a good at a price which the seller is unwilling (or unable) to offer.  There can be a whole host of reasons (including rationing, as during WWII).  In the current economic environment, the barrier to spending (or lowering prices and investing) is one of risk aversion.  Since there is a great deal of external and seemingly uncontrollable risk neither buyers nor sellers are sufficiently confident to agree a price.\r\n\r\nConsumers have an expectation of achieving their price-point, failing that resolution they delay their purchases and make do.  They can do this indefinitely, however, if an opportunity presents (such as Black Friday), they may undertake [rather alarming signalling behaviour][1] in order to secure the good at the price they want.\r\n\r\nIf the price-point demand remains unsatisfied, and there is an expectation that this is being done deliberately and from a position of strength (i.e. [price making][2]) then this could lead to protest movements such as Occupy Wallstreet.\r\n\r\nThis is happening on the side of producers as well.  Since they are not sure there is sufficient market demand to support their sales, and they are not certain if they would be able to borrow to cover investment needs or earnings shortfalls, they look to increase their margins through layoffs, spending freezes and price increases (to target their least price sensitive clients).\r\n\r\nThese two approaches become mutually reinforcing.  Both buyers and sellers would like to find agreement but are too scared to do so.  If confidence can be restored then trade will follow.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, as soon as the price-point at which consumers wish to trade is reached then a large amount of pent-up demand will be resolved since it is based on the expectation of a favourable trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hlDhEBHI9TR5WHmQ8zSPu9lGCJuQ?docId=CNG.771ff36594af25ae8ab323cec142d979.241\r\n  [2]: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricemaker.asp#axzz1f2fChbVU"}

Prostitution, especially in developing countries, is accompanied by a lot of abuse, exploitation, trafficking and forced abduction. This process aims to coerce people into accepting a life of prostitution by systematically closing other options available to them.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is precisely because coercive and downright immoral methods are used by traffickers to force young boys and girls into prostitution that prostitution should be legalised. Legalisation of the trade would allow authorities to better monitor the activity and enable the exploited to seek justice more easily. Economists who support legalisation of prostitution or marijuana usually have such an argument in mind.\r\n\r\nThe **second** deals more directly with economics proper. Suppose we take a truly consensual activity - smoking, for example. This activity has two economically relevant features. **(a)** Smoking is addictive, leading to **time-inconsistent** behaviour, and **(b)** the health costs associated with smoking are borne by society as a whole, so it has **negative externalities**.\r\n\r\nThe problem of addiction and time-inconsistency in **(a)** is studied extensively in decision theory, notably by Gul and Pesendorfer (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0262.00252/full). In a nutshell, their agent takes as given the fact that s/he is unable to stick to past plans (due to addiction or temptation) and then rationally responds to this problem by anticipating future time-inconsistency issues. Thus, it is possible that rational people have a strict preference for a smaller choice set in order to avoid being tempted. The key thing here is that the **content** of preferences has changed, but the way of making choices given that content is still \"rational\" in the sense of acting with foresight, unlimited computational and reasoning power, no mistakes, etc.\r\n\r\n**(b)** is not strictly relevant to your question, but I want to point out that even if limiting people's (legal) choices does not benefit them, it might still be the efficient thing to do from the point of view of society as a whole, because of a standard externalities argument."}

Another way of saying this is that the purchasing power of a dollar-equivalent is far greater in developing countries than the US itself, thus allowing workers in other countries to work for less. For this reason an effective way of bringing back jobs to the US would be to prevent China from undervaluing its currency, which it has been doing for quite a while - How the US would manage to do that is another question :-).

This process aims to coerce people into accepting a life of prostitution by systematically closing other options available to them.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is precisely because coercive and downright immoral methods are used by traffickers to force young boys and girls into prostitution that prostitution should be legalised.

In a world of product differentiation the equilibrium state no longer collapses to zero profits. Indeed, firms can price above marginal cost and make a profit. The higher the degree of product differentiation, the more firms can charge and the higher firm profits.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question it is not obvious that product differentiation improves prosperity. \r\n\r\nIn fact in Bertrand competition, without product competition a greater sum of producer surplus and consumer surplus would be generated. One way to realize is this is that to consider that a manufacturer of a differentiated product faces a downward sloping demand curve just as a monopolist does. The issue with the monopolist is not so much that higher prices are charged (that would be a producer surplus offsetting the loss of the consumer surplus), but that the optimal social quantity of product is not produced (i.e. the sum of producer and consumer surplus is less than optimal).\r\n\r\nSo Kirzner needs to formalize his argument in terms of another model. Intuitively, it is intuitively appealing to link product differentiation to prosperity and consumer innovation of the past several decades. However, Kirzner's economic model that connects this to prosperity or social welfare needs to be formalized (maybe a linkage between product differentiation and funding for R&D or innovation, for example, or a linkage between firm profits and entrepreneurial activity)."}

By 2010 that was down to 9.4 percent. (Source: [USDA Economic Research Service][1]).  Certainly, there was rising prosperity in the US, but there were tremendous social changes as well.\r\n\r\nIn 1943 it took 40 adults to harvest a single row of cotton on the average American farm.  1943 was also the year the first International Harvester cotton-picking machine made its debut picking one row at a time. In 1945 it took 14 hours of labour to produce 100 bushels of corn on two acres of land.  By 1987 it took 3 hours of labour to produce that same 100 bushels.\r\n\r\nAdd in mass cold chains and big-box retails stores with their sophisticated distribution systems and just-in-time production and you have exponentially-improved levels of efficiency and reduction of waste of perishable food.\r\n\r\nAll of this has a tremendous impact on the cost of living.  People who spend less on food as a proportion of their income have more money to invest in material well-being and future opportunities (like education for their children).\r\n\r\nCountries like India make the investment by large retailers [like Walmart deliberately difficult][2] even as their own small retailers are inefficient (wasting as much as 30 percent of perishable food).  The FAO has recently released [a report detailing the levels of food waste][3].\r\n\r\nThis is just detailing food, often the largest proportion of expenditure for the poor living in the less developed economies.

Of course, some economists correlate falling prices with a depression but this is not always the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://mises.org/books/historyofmoney.pdf\r\n  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/bD0ww.png"}

That matrix then results in changes to mode choice (road vs rail vs water vs air), destination choice, and even origin (location of factory / distribution centre) choice. That provides a new distribution of costs and employment, which then goes into the top-level economic model, producing changes to economic activity.\r\n\r\nAnd then that whole lot gets iterated around again and again, until it converges.\r\n\r\nSo,  the number of economic factors that go into your cost-benefit analysis can be pretty huge. It's not only changes to delay costs for freight and other traffic, and accident costs, but it can feed into distribution of employment, business location, and inter-sector competition, if the impacts are high enough.\r\n\r\nOften, the impacts at the whole-economy level are very small, and the only modelling done is at the micro-sim level. That can easily give the wrong answer, not only getting the magnitude of the cost-benefit balance wrong, but even its sign: there are higher-level equilibriums at play than just the traffic flow on a particular route, that can give positive or negative feedbacks."}

Suppose that you do not really need a house but expect house prices to rise in a particular area for some reason (e.g., booming economy so people are getting richer and will want to buy houses of their own; the area is about to be connected by a metro/train, increasing its attractiveness as a residential property, etc.). A good idea (if you are sure the prices will rise) is to buy a house right now at a low price, wait for the prices to increase and then sell it for a net gain. Since you are speculating that the prices will rise, the resulting demand is called **speculative demand**.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of speculation can be very lucrative. However, note that this means a lot of buyers are in the market simply to re-sell the house later on and will not really consume the good. In economic jargon, such a circumstance leads to what is called a **bubble**: the price in the market exceeds the price dictated by \"real\" demand, or \"fundamentals\", due to speculation.\r\n\r\nEventually, bubbles burst. Roughly speaking, the reason for this is simply that the fundamentals of the market do not justify a sky-high price. As a result, after a few months (or years) of rising house prices, potential speculators realize that the price is not going to rise any further. But now no speculator wants to hold on to the good! There is a flurry of selling and prices fall dramatically.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Other examples include speculation in the stock market, and in the market for foodgrains in many countries."}

This makes future borrowing by the Greek government very expensive since there is now a risk that lenders will not get their money back.

If demand for a good $i$ can be represented as a function $x_i(\\cdot)$ of income for some consumer, we say $i$ is a *luxury good* if for income levels $0<m\\leq m'$, one has $\\frac{x_i(m)}{m}\\leq\\frac{x_i(m')}{m'}$, that is $\\frac{x_i(\\cdot)}{\\cdot}$ is an increasing function. A sufficient condition for this is that $x_i$ is differentiable and $\\bigg(\\frac{x_i(m)}{m}\\bigg)'>0$ for positive income levels $m$. Applying the quotient rule, this is equivalent to $$\\frac{x'_i(m)-mx_i(m)}{m^2}>0$$\r\n$$\\frac{x'_i(m)}{m^2}>\\frac{x_i(m)}{m}$$\r\n$$\\frac{x'_i(m)}{m}>x_i(m)$$\r\n$$x'_i(m)\\frac{m}{x_i(m)}>1.$$\r\nThe left side of the inequality is simply the income elasticity of demand for good $i$.\r\n\r\n2. This is a bit more complicated, since quasi-linearity is a property of utility functions or preferences, not demand. Since the demand function you gave does not depend on  income, the income elasticity is indeed $0$. This holds true for quasi-linear utility functions at interior solutions. If you don't allow for $y$ to be negative, there are always boundary solutions for $m$ small enough. \r\n\r\nAnother, more demaning question is, is whether preferences giving rise to constant interior demand for a good are quasi-linear (under some regularity conditions). I dont know the answer to this question, I guess one might obtain a positie nswer by using [Gorman's theorem][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.esr.ie/Vol34_2Neary.pdf"}

During the crisis banks were scrambling for cash to meet customer demands for cash.  Customers were liquidating their securities and money market accounts for cash.  Foreign banks wanted USDs because they are the most liquid and therefore can be used in almost any type of currency swap, repurchase agreement, or currency exchange giving the bank strength to obtain more foreign currency through any one of these arrangements as well as giving the bank the ability to provide its customers with USDs which were in high demand during the crisis.\r\n\r\n> Why the foreign banks were desperate for US dollars is the reason of\r\n> violations of covered interest parity?\r\n\r\nCovered interest parity is a way to hedge against a \"carry trade\" transaction going against an investor.  \r\n\r\nAs an example, let's say the current exchange rate is 1 USD = 100 Yen and the current 1 year interest rate is 10% in US and 20% in Japan.  If I save 100 USDs, at the end of 1 year I'll have 110 USDs (100 USD * 1.10).  If instead, I exchanged my 100 USDs for 10,000 yen and saved in yen I would have 12,000 yen (10,000 * 1.20).  If the exchange rate is still 1 USD = 100 yen then when I exchange my 12,000 yen back to USDs I will have 120 USDs.  I effectively had a 20% return on my USDs.  \r\n\r\nBut what if the exchange rate changes during the year?  \r\n\r\nWhat if the exchange rate at the end of the year is 1 USD = 200 Yen.  When I exchange back to USDs I will now only have 60 USDs.  I would experience a loss of 40 USDs on my initial investment of 100 USDs.  To hedge against this I enter into a forward currency exchange contract for the end of the year at a predetermined exchange rate to hedge against changes in the exchange rate.  For the above case I would purchase a futures contract to exchange yen to USDs at a rate of 1 USD = 109.09 yen at the end of one year.  This way at the end of the year when I exchange my yen back to USD I will be guaranteed an exchange rate of 109.09 which yields me 12,000 / 109.09 = 110 which is what I would have made had I invested the USDs at home.\r\n\r\nA violation of the hedge would be to enter into a futures contract for the currency where the investor, even with the contract as a hedge, could experience a loss with the current exchange rates and interest rates.  This was occurring because of the high demand for USDs.  Investors were entering into currency contracts that violated the covered interest parity formulas because investors were desperate for USDs."}

Evidence from a Large-Scale Policy Experiment\") which I saw presented recently provides some evidence that debt relief unfortunately does not solve the problem of debt overhang.\r\n\r\nI wonder, however, to what extent the lack of impact is due to the periodic (rather than one-time) nature of the debt relief: it will work only when it's unexpected.\r\n\r\nNote also that the primary motive of debt relief in the dataset Kanz uses is not the reduction of debt overhang, but the prevention of farmer suicides due to extreme indebtedness. If debt relief is provided with the aim of reducing debt overhang and accompanied by some administrative will it could have very different consequences (I'm an optimist!)\r\n\r\nPS: Kanz's paper was also featured [here](http://chrisblattman.com/2011/11/16/what-do-jubilees-do-the-impacts-of-debt-relief-in-india/), which is a great source for keeping track of recent interesting findings in development economics."}

Both are very prosperous countries, with some of the highest median standards of living in the world, and Denmark in particular repeatedly scores highest in the world on quality of life (taking into account direct economic measures as well as other measures). So it would be very hard to make a case that their regional development has been very detrimental to their economies.\r\n\r\nIt will depend on where a country is within its economic cycle. At the moment, in Europe, rates of return are extremely low. Which means that the discount rate applied to long-term investment is also very low. And that means that large, long-lived capital schemes that carry on delivering benefits for many decades, will show a much better Net Present Value. To take that bridge, for example, that cost NOK 230m (US\\$40m at exchange rates of 2011-12-09); with a discount rate of 2%, then that amounts to just NOK4.6m (US\\$0.8m) per year. Now, if most of the capital expenditure stayed within Norway anyway, and the bridge creates a few permanent jobs, then the business case will quickly stack up.\r\n\r\nRegional development also plays a role in compensating for the economic inefficiencies that come about from having economically-disparate regions sharing a common currency - see http://economics.stackexchange.com/q/18/104 for related issues. Now, if they had different currencies, then exchange rates could vary to take account of different regions being at different parts of their economic cycle. Interest rates could also vary between regions. So there would be several additional adjustment mechanisms that would enable one region that was economically suffering, to have higher investment and cheaper exports to regions that were doing better.  When those regions share a currency, and there is no exchange rate to vary, and no opportunity for differential interest rates, then regional development can provide inter-regional adjustment mechanisms, and improve economic efficiency. Particularly if there are impediments to the movement of labour between regions.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, high inter-regional variations in wealth can create a wide variety of social, criminal and health problems for all regions concerned; reducing wealth-differentials can reduce those problems, making everyone better off as a result (see [The Spirit Level][1] for more on this).\r\n\r\nThat's not to say by any means that all regional development is desirable or economically successful: there are plenty of examples of failure too. And that can happen due to a variety of reasons: incompetence, corruption, bad timing, bad luck.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/SearchResults?an=wilkinson&bt.x=0&bt.y=0&sts=t&tn=spirit%20level"}

If an asset is liquid, it means that any buyer of the asset, long-term or short-term, will know that they are likely to be able to sell this asset whenever they would need to. This is certainly an advantage, because it means that there is less risk of getting stuck with an asset one does not want to own. If lots of assets have a high level of liquidity, it means that capital can be allocated more efficiently. \r\n\r\nOne example is if I was the CEO of an airline company. I identify the volatility of the price of aviation fuel as the biggest risk for the company. In order to hedge this risk, I want to buy aviation fuel futures, which might be what one would call an exotic asset. The problem is that there is not enough liquidity in this market, so I cannot buy any such futures at a decent price. Any trading of aviation fuel futures, including microsecond trading, would help increase its liquidity. However, since the liquidity of the airline fuel market is too low, I would be forced to buy oil futures instead. The oil price and the aviation fuel prices are likely to correlate, so this is quite suitable for hedging my risk. However, in the event of a sudden reduction in refinery capacity (for example because of a war), then my risk would maybe not be hedged, so the airline might get in trouble because of the sudden rise in aviation fuel prices. \r\n\r\nI would argue that any increase in the number of assets available (including exotic assets), would in general enable more efficient allocation of capital, as one can find the asset that exactly matches ones needs. This could for example be the need for hedging. I have, however, not discussed any negative effects of such assets or microsecond trading."}

For example, in the UK there are two widely recognised indices: The official Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Retail Prices Index. Both of which have different baskets of goods or calculation methods and both of which have different values. These refer to the typical inflation faced by the typical consumer.\r\n\r\nAn additional problem is that price-level inflation is not constant across goods and industries; producers face different types of inflation to consumers, and a set of different issues such as how production of inventory should be valued.\r\n\r\nBeyond these problems with deriving a measure for real GDP, to make country GDPs comparable (whether nominal or real) some measure of comparing local values is necessary. In practice this is done with exchange rates to a benchmark currency, typically the USD. However, exchange rates factor in certain elements that ought not to be included in a GDP, such as risk-profiles of the currency markets, transitory liquidity preferences as well as biases of LIBOR etc.\r\n\r\nAll these problems in deriving a comparable GDP are open to errors and manipulation in the longrun. However, in practice, with the exception of what inflation rates to use for various goods, a government has limited scope for changing these. \r\n\r\nGDP is free of much of the government manipulation that often occurs for publishing budget deficits (e.g. what is counted - see Eurozone, UK and other countries for examples of the classification certain forms of debt as outside the balance budget requirements) because GDP is an aggregate measure."}

This can be reinforced by tighter bank-regulation causing them to increase their  capital reserves, and be much more reticent about lending: again, these are all contractionary. If, on top of that, some government engage in fiscal contraction (e.g. UK, Italy, Greece), then the pressure on broad money is even more contractionary. These things can lead to a combination of reductions in broad money, and reductions in money velocity.\r\n\r\nAlthough some narratives of money supply forecast that broad money results from increases in narrow money according to a money multiplier, [analysis by Seth B. Carpenter and Selva Demiralp][1] for the US Federal Reserve Board in 2010 found that the money multiplier was not a useful notion.

This affects the overall supply of US Treasuries.  If the US government only spent money it received in taxes then the US government would not need to issue US Treasuries to borrow money.\r\n 2. **Bond mix.**  The Treasury can change the mix of bonds issued to meet the borrowing needs of the US government.\r\n\r\n> What options does the treasury have in managing the interest rate\r\n> curve by modifying the supply?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the US Treasuries determines the mix of bonds that will be issued to meet the borrowing requirements of the US government.  Thus, the Treasury can affect the supply of different bonds by determining the mix of bonds to use to meet borrowing needs.\r\n\r\nDuring the financial crisis there was a large demand for short term treasuries.  The US Treasury met this demand by financing most of the government borrowing over the last 3 years with short term bills (i.e. less than a year).

A bank that is identified as a \"Primary Dealer\" (e.g. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, etc.), however, is obligated to purchase US Treasuries at auction.  This guarantees there will always be a market for US government debt and there will never be a failed debt auction.\r\n\r\n> Could the government be funded exclusively via the federal reserves\r\n> overnight lending at the feds stated rates?\r\n\r\nThe US government cannot borrow directly from the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve works with its primary dealers to purchase US debt.  A primary dealer could borrow from the FED and use the borrowed money to purchase US debt.\r\n\r\nIndirectly the FED can print money to fund the US government.  The FED has increased its balance sheet of US debt of over \\$600 billion over the last year.  In took the newly printed \\$600 billion and used it to purchase US bonds from primary dealers.  Thus, the US government was primarily being financed by money printed by the FED.

If interest rates increased the Treasury would also find itself paying higher rates and perhaps fail to roll-over the large quantities of debt required.\r\n\r\nAlso the ability of the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy would be undermined by a loss of credibility in the value of the currency and the policy messaging from the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://treasurydirect.gov/RT/RTGateway?page=institHome"}

It is about free choice and trade.\r\n\r\nConsider the US where different states have different tax rates, different wage differentials and efficiences.  All of this has resulted in dramatically different investment rates for the different states.  It isn't only about countries, but about states/provinces and towns as well.\r\n\r\nTrade can permit consumer choice.  If substitutable products can be imported at a lower price then all consumers gain spending power, able to spend their savings on other products (or save and invest to improve their lives).  This comes at the expense of the minority of previous incumbents who lose their pricing power (but who may continue to have political power).\r\n\r\nYour assumption that such trade is bad is really about what free trade exposes: inefficiency.  If an artificial barrier has permitted businesses to hide their inefficiency (or even [rent seeking][1] behaviour) then they may struggle with new competitors.  Such competition can either force local businesses to improve, or lead them to demand new protections which raise prices for all consumers still further.\r\n\r\nProtectionism can take many forms and isn't only about trade between countries.  A town which refuses to allow a Walmart to open is deliberately protecting smaller, inefficient, local businesses from a discount competitor.  They are choosing higher prices to save some businesses.\r\n\r\nLower prices are better for consumers (or choice is better, since it permits a greater variety of expression) but it can also lead to tremendous disruption as all these inefficiencies are exposed and responded to (for better or worse).  Jobs can be lost (with the perception that they are being \"outsourced\") and local economies experience short-term erosion.  If poor support exists for those unemployed workers then they may never regain employment.  This speaks less about the dangers of international trade than it does about local flexibility, adaptability and support for change.\r\n\r\nAs Warren Buffet said, \"It is only when the tide has gone out that we get to see who has been bathing naked.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking"}

Some of the very basics:\r\n\r\n - In a partial equilibrium framework, we can show that the home country's consumers gain from imports while it's producers lose.  The basic idea is that a good is not imported unless the world price is lower than the price that would prevail in the country in the absence of trade (\"autarky\").  Consumers benefit from lower prices, producers do not.\r\n - Using a Heckscher-Ohlin type of model, we can show that owners of factors of production (e.g., broadly, laborers or capital owners) gain or lose from trade liberalization, depending on whether they own a relatively scarce factor or the relatively abundant factor.  See: http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/721/application-of-the-factorprice-equalization-theorem-samuelson-on-trade\r\n - In a Ricardian model, we can show that consumption possibilities increase with trade as countries exploit differences in technology.  E.g. a country can export a good it is relatively better at producing and trade it for a good in which another country has a comparative advantage.  See: http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/718/international-commerce-main-differences-between-theories-of-comparative-and-abs\r\n\r\nOther models deal with more complex issues, such as multinational corporations, trade in intermediate goods, the effects on growth, and so on, but **a general theme is that some groups benefit from trade liberalization, and others loose**.  Thus, producers in a given industry will tend to lobby against liberalization of their sector while consumers would be expected to desire trade liberalization (though the average U.S. and EU consumer seems to lean towards the protectionist end of the spectrum). \r\n"}

Since war is a means to end (or perhaps war is a means to establish supremacy during) a conflict, then yes, war is caused by conflicting self interest. I believe that psychologists over the answer to this question, and I am not qualified enough to answer it.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, if wars are bad for the general population because it\r\n> kills them and destroys property, is it in the self interest of the\r\n> leaders because they profit from it?\r\n\r\nTwo propositions here: a) War is bad for general populace. b) War is profitable for leaders.\r\n\r\nI would argue that both are neither true nor false.\r\n\r\nWar's affect on general populace (both negative and positive):\r\n\r\n - A fraction of the populace employed as a fighting force will die.\r\n - Some fraction of the populace will die, if war takes place on/around their area of residence.\r\n - War will generate employment - as fighting forces.\r\n - War infrastructure may generate employment - as weapons manuacturers etc.\r\n - Winning/losing a war will have an effect on national identity, thus changing the psychology of the populace.\r\n - Resources spent on the war may lead to lower standard of living\r\n - Resources gained from war may lead to higher standard of living.\r\n - The outcome of the war may lead to political changes, which may widely affect the lives of the population on a very long term basis. (For example, the victory of England over India from 1757-1857 allowed for the colonisation of India, leading to a flow of wealth from India to England. This probably decreased Indian standard of living, while improving England's. )\r\n\r\nAs far as leaders go, the popularity of leaders will change with the outcome/status of war. Winning a war will increase popularity (and possibly wealth in case of ogliarchies/monarchies etc.) , while losing one will lead to loss of popularity (and possible death, exile, loss of property etc.). So, war for leaders is like a high-risk high-profit activity.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that while modern (political) leaders do not usually fight alongwith troops, in more ancient times, this was not always the case and leaders were expected to fight alongwith troops.\r\n\r\n> Thus, leaders exploit the population so that their utility increases? (i.e. money)\r\n\r\nSince a leader is not always facing an increase in utility, this is not true. But, it might be argued that a leader will not start/fight a war without having a belief in victory (of one sort or other), so a leader is trying to increase *expected* utility. Since the war may also lead to benefits for the population, it cannot perhaps be said to be exploitation. \r\n\r\n> In addition, leaders refer to patriotism, nationalism and religion when they declare wars. Do these concepts give an illusion to the general population that their utility will increase (i.e. safety and better afterlife) in a vague intangible way?\r\n\r\nThese concepts affect the psyche of the population, and thus cannot said to be totally intangible. After all, happiness in life counts for *something*, and if a person finds utility in religion, then a religious war may indeed increase his utility.\r\n\r\n> Last, do leaders never look out for interest of the general population, and do they always look for themselves first? Therefore, do those in power always exploit those not in power when they feel like it, i.e. their interests are not aligned?\r\n\r\nIf you believe the assumption of the book, that all humans are ultimately selfish, then yes. Otherwise, one can only say that it depends upon the psychology of the leader. A leader may himself believe in concepts like patriotism, honour, religion etc. and start/fight a war for those reasons."}

Now the fact that a lot of people do this will weaken the US dollar to the brazilian Real ( a lot of people will exchange dollar for real, theres a large demand for real and a large supply of dollars). this Real strength will then attract more buyers and the trend is strengthened even more. however once this trend is broken for whatever reason ( a financial crisis for example) this trade will be reversed and all the money will flow out of brazil which will lead to a drop in value of the Real versus the dollar. \r\nIn order to understand the way carry trades on exchange rates you have to understand the reflexivity theory in financial markets. I stated above that the carry trade is strengthening the Real and the strength of the real is attracting more buyers however if the Real was dropping in value, would this carry trade still be made? so this is a very reflexive cycle and these currency exchanges move in waves.\r\nPlease do look into reflexivity theory and you will why there are conflicting theories.

The rate they are willing to buy them at depends on where they feel they can get the best return for the risk.

Because of their leveraged nature an uncovered position permits large positions for a given upfront capital, allowing larger market influences. What perhaps needs to change is legislation regarding the legality of purposefully using concentrated short positions as a market manipulator.\r\n\r\n**Rapid automated trading** (algo-trading) is often used to 'scalp' any microinefficiencies from a market. They are therefore valuable to the market and between markets as a means of rapidly 'ironing' out pricing irregularities, and ensuring parity between different markets. However, a darker side of automated trading is to market manipulate to trigger price caps/ceilings/collars of investor positions, then mopping up the resulting puts/calls.\r\n\r\n**MBS** do not inherently make the market less stable. The issues over the past few years are not over the products, but from mis-understanding the products. Risk-pooling is effective and completely valid. However, by treating MBS as independent to one another and as spreading risk from individual mortgage consumers (through risk pooling) pricing of MBS failed to account for the - now understood - element of covariance between mortgage defaults. Furthermore, unlike previous Building society type mortgages, the risk is passed on to the MBS holders thus the bank / mortgage lender becomes a broker, disincentivising proper due diligence and incentivising accepting lower-quality debt. As a result of commanding a too small risk premium, MBS were overvalued.\r\n"}

The coming of Facebook didn't reduce demand for internet search, neither did it have much impact on the declining fortunes of newspapers which were already disrupted by new forms of information interchange.\r\n\r\nSchumpeter's Creative Destruction can apply in cases where direct displacement has taken place (e.g. online news and fast publication cycles replaces daily print news) but not in cases where they are entirely new services (like Twitter, which hardly appears to be a replacement for the exponential growth of SMS).\r\n\r\nThe low barriers to entry and start-up costs have also permitted a diversification to serve fringe interests leading a vast range of tiny businesses serving minority interests.\r\n\r\nAll these would mitigate against worrying about innovation being a cause of any economic stagnation."}

Chinese oligopolies today compete with Russian, Brazilian, Korean and Indian state-protected champions.\r\n\r\nNone of this means that such champions are a good idea.

This makes them unpopular and increases their exposure to non-business risk.\r\n\r\nIt is not that state-supported monopolies can't be competitive when forced to tussle for the same consumers as other state-supported monopolies, it is that they are unaccountable and disrupt the common law.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company\r\n  [2]: http://www.economist.com/node/21541753"}

A monopoly, like existed in the US with the Telecom industry until deregulation in the 80's, one company dominates and excludes other companies from competing by denying them access to the market.  A patent simply protects an invention for a limited time so that the inventor is the only one able to legally produce the product.  That does not prevent another company from inventing another product that does something similar or even better.\r\n\r\nThis protection allows companies to make innovative products and reap the rewards.  It opens new markets that did not exist before.  In 1980 we had 4 of the same rotary phone in different colors in our house.  The technology was the same as it was in 1970.  We could not go buy a new phone at the store (unless it was an AT&T store).  There was no effort to innovate because AT&T would not let you use the new products on their network.  \r\n\r\nBy 1990 that had changed because AT&T saw the wireless wave coming so they surrendered their monopoly on Telecom so they could innovate and compete in the future.  The industry exploded.  Apple released their iPhone in 2007.  They still have a monopoly on the iPhone.  But because the marketplace is open other smart phones have popped up to compete.   That is the difference between a true monopoly where competition is stifled and a patent that protects the original work but encourages others to create something similar and to improve."}

For example, the invention of steam-powered electrical production did result in the destruction of the oil and candle-as-lighting industries.  If this direct replacement had resulted in fewer steam-engine workers replacing the existing industry then stagnation may have resulted.  It didn't.  Instead it resulted in a proliferation of new products and services.\r\n\r\nIn terms of Google, Facebook, et al, what equivalents did they replace?  More importantly \u2013 small as they may be in terms of individual employees \u2013 what new industries have they created?  What we've seen is a new innovation (low-cost telecommunications requiring an investment only in virtual infrastructure - i.e. software and hosting) which resulted in a massive diversification of services.\r\n\r\nConsider that Google has created the entire [search-engine optimisation industry (42 million results)][1].  Youtube has created companies which specialise in short-form movie-making (e.g. [The Guild][2]).  Think of all the blog platforms that have created [new publications][3].  Facebook has stimulated a [multi-billion dollar social gaming industry][4].  All have created new forms of advertising and creative media.  Tens of millions of new jobs have resulted.\r\n\r\nEach of these individually may be very small but their cumulative effect has transformed our world economy and social interactions.  \r\n\r\nNeither are these new technologies directly displacing each other.  The coming of Facebook didn't reduce demand for internet search, neither did it have much impact on the declining fortunes of newspapers which were already disrupted by new forms of information interchange.\r\n\r\nSchumpeter's Creative Destruction can apply in cases where direct displacement has taken place (e.g. online news and fast publication cycles replaces daily print news) but not in cases where they are entirely new services (like Twitter, which hardly appears to be a replacement for the exponential growth of SMS).\r\n\r\nThe low barriers to entry and start-up costs have also permitted a diversification to serve fringe interests leading a vast range of tiny businesses serving minority wants.\r\n\r\nAll these would mitigate against worrying about innovation being a cause of any economic stagnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=engine%20optimisation&meta=#pq=engine%20optimisation&hl=en&cp=13&gs_id=1i&xhr=t&q=search%20optimisation&pf=p&sclient=psy-ab&safe=off&source=hp&pbx=1&oq=search%20optimi&aq=0&aqi=g4&aql=&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&fp=af889145c41a6ec4&biw=1370&bih=984\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guild\r\n  [3]: http://technorati.com/blogs/top100/\r\n  [4]: http://company.zynga.com/"}

Specifically, politicians with short term electoral goals have an incentive to introduce populist measures which boost the economy (or specific electorally significant areas of the economy) in the short term but are far more damaging in the longer term. An example of this would be quantitative easing (in plain terms: pumping newly created money into the economy) when the economy is running smoothly in the hope that this will generate an economic boom just before an election.\r\nIt's also worth pointing out the obvious: the average member of a central bank has considerably deeper and broader knowledge of economic policy implications than the average Minister. Similarly, healthcare and military services tend to be entrusted to experts even when the government is paying their bills.\r\n\r\nThe corollary to that argument is that whereas politicians are at least periodically accountable to the electorate for their decisions, central bankers generally aren't. For that reason it's important the government has at least some oversight over the central bank to ensure that they aren't abusing their mandate for their own ends. For this reason, it's often considered desirable for the central bank to be given specific publicly-declared objectives to achieve: for example obliging them to attempt to keep inflation close to an agreed acceptable level."}

And suppose that subsequently many economic benefits of the interaction become apparent: perhaps they wish to buy our computers because they are faster than theirs, and we wish to buy their rocket ships because they are more efficient than ours.  Soon an interstellar trade is established at a certain exchange rate.  Alien corporations are established on both worlds.  What are some general strategies to minimize risk in these situations?  Given that a single currency is superior to a multi-good barter system here on Earth, is the same true in such an interstellar distributed system with high communication latency?

One tool that comes to my mind is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem\">CAP theorem</a> which seems to place limits on the effectiveness.  In a context of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_system\">distributed systems</a>, one might imagine bartering persistent storage space for serial computation speed (e.g., I have a 386 with a 1TB hard-drive; you have a 3GHz processor with only a floppy disk; and we are connected with a certain latency).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Quantum Mechanics suggests the possibility of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation\">win-win situations</a> that would not be possible in a classical or purely relativistic universe.  Can this somehow mitigate the confusion caused by considering General Relativity?  If we place a computer in interstellar space midway between here and Alpha Centauri, that helps, but what if we place a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer\">quantum computer</a> there?\r\n\r\nUltimately I am wondering how can financial risk be calculated in the future when our current physical knowledge is exploited in the form of technology?"}

And suppose that subsequently many economic benefits of the interaction become apparent: perhaps they wish to buy our computers because they are faster than theirs, and we wish to buy their rocket ships because they are more efficient than ours.  Soon an interstellar trade is established at a certain exchange rate.  Alien corporations are established on both worlds.  What are some general strategies to minimize risk in these situations?  Given that a single currency is superior to a multi-good barter system here on Earth, is the same true in such an interstellar distributed system with high communication latency?  Does the nature of stocks and bonds change in the presence of this latency?  For example, does the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-Scholes_formula\">Black-Scholes formula</a> apply just as well as it does locally?\r\n\r\nThis aspect is quite analogous to foreign trade prior to radio.  How did radio influence the theoretical development and applications of economics?\r\n\r\nI recall reading somewhere that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency_trading\">HFT</a> benefits from the placement of data centers at intermediate points (e.g. the mid-Atlantic or mid-Pacific).  Is this true, and is there a reference for the existence or effectiveness of any such practice?  One tool that comes to my mind is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem\">CAP theorem</a> which seems to place limits on the effectiveness.  In a context of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_system\">distributed systems</a>, one might imagine bartering persistent storage space for serial computation speed (e.g., I have a 386 with a 1TB hard-drive; you have a 3GHz processor with only a floppy disk; and we are connected with a certain latency).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Quantum Mechanics suggests the possibility of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation\">win-win situations</a> that would not be possible in a classical or purely relativistic universe.  Can this somehow mitigate the confusion caused by considering General Relativity?  If we place a computer in interstellar space midway between here and Alpha Centauri, that helps, but what if we place a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer\">quantum computer</a> there?  Would that help even more?\r\n\r\nUltimately I am wondering how can financial risk be calculated in the future when our current physical knowledge is exploited in the form of technology?"}

However, that's really stretching it.\r\n\r\nIt's **changes** in one currency relative to others that might tell us something about changes in economic outlook for a particular currency.  To get an idea of the status of a specific currency, one might either look at its value against a basket of other currencies; or against a very liquid currency against which it floats in value, e.g. the Euro [EUR], the Swiss Franc [CHF], UK Sterling [GBP], or the US dollar [USD]).\r\n\r\nOne way of looking at a currency is to think of it as equity in a nation (or other currency area). So, for example, GBP could be thought of as equity in the UK economy. Extending this analogy, changes in GBP's exchange rate with EUR / CHF / USD can indicate something about expectations about future income streams (UK interest rates), about consensus expectations of the UK economy, and of future equity dilutions (e.g. through Quantitative Easing). But that's only an analogy, so don't extend it too far.\r\n\r\nMore simply and directly, changes in exchange rates reflect changes in demand and supply of that currency, relative to other currencies."}

If there's less money in circulation, or lower monetary velocity, prices and wages will fall.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of historical examples of societies which had positive economic growth and deflation or pretty much zero inflation. So it's perfectly possible.\r\n\r\nImagine that in one year workers produced 100 widgets each, got 100 galactic credits in wages (1 per widget produced), and widgets cost 1.5 galactic credit each to buy. Then 10 years later, everyone worker made 200 widgets, earned the same 100 galactic credit (at much lower wage 0.5 credit per widget!), and widget pries fell proportionally to 0.75 credits per widget. Even though unit wages are now much lower, and total wages stayed stagnant, workers can now afford twice as many widgets as before.\r\n\r\nIf workers now things are getting cheaper fast, they'll accept stagnant or even decreasing nominal wages - in theory they should care about their real purchasing power in terms of what they can buy with their wages, not with some numbers on bank statement. In practice it's somewhere in between - people mostly care about real purchasing power of their wages, but they care quite a bit more about numbers than rational expectations claim they should. (that's called \"money illusion\").\r\n\r\nDue to variety of problems like money illusion, zero bound, downward wage and price stickiness, debt deflation etc. deflation tends to quite harmful to economic activity, and even very low inflation (0%-4%) may not always be optimal. Empirically countries with modest but not negligible inflation (5%-20%) seem to do the best, but the difference between modest inflation countries and very low inflation countries is not that huge."}

What is the incentive behind trusting Greece again and lending so much money, apart from humanity?\r\n\r\nAlso, the European Financial Stability Facility has made banks agree to a 50% cut on their greek holdings. Why would banks agree to lose something and how would the people invested in those banks react to this step?"}

Germany (and, prior to its ratings downgrade, France) secured the bulk of European Currency Board debt through the strength of their AAA ratings.  This permitted weaker European economies to borrow at lower rates than they would otherwise be able to afford.  It also fueled a debt boom in which Greece, amongst others, borrowed a large amount.\r\n\r\nThe problem for Europe in just sacrificing Greece is what events have already shown: investors start to question the strength of the entire Eurozone and the security of all their loans in Euros if the EU is not prepared to stand surety for one small member.\r\n\r\nGermany believes, as you have stated, that bad lenders should be cut loose.  However, Germany and France between them stand to lose a trillions of Euros in loans to their local banks if they simply let the weaker Euro members economies collapse.  Instead of writing off say, 50c in the Euro, they may have to write off the lot.\r\n\r\nFar better to create a bailout package that permits these economies to restructure and get back on track than let them collapse and plunge not just their, but every, economy into fiscal crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\r\n  [2]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15748696"}

Some can only create in plastics, while others are specialized in titanium devices. Similar with forms and sizes, and specifications about accuracy. To simplify this, we can assume that there are 500 specializations. Some of these will be hugely more popular than other ones. Please make the assumptions you need to with regards to this."}

It would be difficult to hide such a scheme and upon detection a government may step in and preempt such a maneuver.

Two things are assumed **constant** by definition of the **short run**: \r\n\r\n 1. The availability of one or more fixed inputs (typically physical capital)\r\n\r\n 2. the number of firms in the industry\r\nSupply curve (as we only talk about supply here) represents:\r\n\r\nUnder the above conditions, we can accept two basic laws about the supply curve:\r\n\r\n 1. If demand increases (demand curve changes to D2 from D1) and supply remains unchanged, then it leads to higher equilibrium price and quantity.\r\n\r\n 2. If demand decreases (demand curve changes to D1 from D2) and supply remains unchanged, then it leads to lower equilibrium price and quantity.\r\n\r\nThe key point is that all these curves are under the assumption of **[perfect competition][1]**. But it doesn't mean they're not useful or real, as they are helping us to have a comprehensible model of a market.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout your second question: We're not talking about a single seller. We're talking about the market. Suppose that the demand reaches to a specific point (unchanged supply) which causes prices to rise. In this case the profit margin for producers (suppliers) increases and they will increase their supply to sell more and gain more profit. Now the supply is not fixed any more and more supply in the market causes the prices to come down. So it's not like nothing has happened and with no apparent reason suppliers increase their supply.\r\n\r\nAbout the textbook, I recommend you the following book:\r\n> Principles of Microeconomics by N.

Nor are they deal-breakers - plenty of successful commercial operators offer this sort of staggered discount scheme without harm.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of potential advantages to a company that offers them:\r\n\r\n1) they're relatively easy to understand; and that increases sales.\r\n\r\n2) Particularly astute people who spot the anomalies feel that they can get one over the company by ordering just above the threshold. But once they've psychologically broken that threshold, they may go higher still. c.f. the seemingly illogical pricing of some web & print publications, that offer, say, web-only subscription \u00a350, print-only subscription \u00a3150, web & print subscription \u00a3150. Now, that seems illogical, right? Why would anyone go for a print-only subscription at \u00a3150 when they can get web & print for the same price? Well, for the publisher, this is a pricing trick, that converts **web** sales into web & print sales, boosting their revenue: people spot the anomaly, and change their preference from a web-only subscription to a web & print one, because they feel that the \"illogical\" pricing gives them extra value.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, that's just a couple of reasons why seemingly-illogical pricing structures can be a desirable thing.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed discount structures that remove such anomalies. Here's one - it doesn't try to match the discount curve outlined in the question as closely as possible, but it's not far off:\r\n\r\nFor any given block-order of students:\r\n\r\n - first five students named pay $200\r\n - the next 45 students named pay $190\r\n - the next 100 students named pay $185\r\n - all students named thereafter pay $180\r\n\r\nBut that's more complex, and it looks unfair; and those are two potential deterrents to a potential purchaser."}

See this [link][1] for what a carbon tax is. In short it's a Pigouvian tax that aims to reduce a negative externality: pollution associated to the use of goods and services with a carbon content. \r\n\r\nThe triple dividend that is normally referred to in the literature encompasses: a) a green dividend - as emissions are reduced, b) a blue dividend - as carbon taxes provide tax revenue that, in a revenue-neutral setting, allow other distortionary taxes to be lowered, thus making the tax system more efficient, and c) a third dividend that some consider to be a GDP or social welfare dividend, either linked to the idea of a more sustainable development, or simply having more income, or even (as I0ve recently seen) related to redistributional concerns.\r\n\r\nMy question is how real are triple dividends in the empirical/applied economics literatures?\r\n\r\nMy fundamental quibble (or stumbling block) is that these goods and services with a carbon content (basically heating and transportation) have a very low price elasticity of demand (there are very few substitutes and they are essential goods anyway) so it seems that there won't be a reduction in emissions anyway. If not, what am I missing?

See this [link][1] for what a carbon tax is. In short it's a Pigouvian tax that aims to reduce a negative externality: pollution associated to the use of goods and services with a carbon content. \r\n\r\nThe triple dividend that is normally referred to in the literature encompasses: a) a green dividend - as emissions are reduced, b) a blue dividend - as carbon taxes provide tax revenue that, in a revenue-neutral setting, allow other distortionary taxes to be lowered, thus making the tax system more efficient, and c) a third dividend that some consider to be a GDP or social welfare dividend, either linked to the idea of a more sustainable development, or simply having more income, or even (as I've recently seen) related to redistributional concerns.\r\n\r\nHow real are triple dividends in the empirical/applied economics literatures?\r\n\r\nMy fundamental quibble (or stumbling block) is that these goods and services with a carbon content (basically heating and transportation) have a very low price elasticity of demand (there are very few substitutes and they are essential goods anyway) so it seems that there won't be a reduction in emissions anyway. If not, what am I missing?

The economic risks of failure to cut GHGs are potentially immense - the worst-case forecasts are of a loss of 90%+ of global GDP - but there are also high short-term political risks of setting a carbon tax high enough to be effective. The best-case forecasts are a loss of 2-5% of global GDP, relative to a contra-factual case of business as usual and GHGs being climate-neutral. With the cost of decarbonisation estimated at around 1% of GDP, the economics are overwhelmingly in favour of curbing GHG emissions. There have been very long discussions about the relative merits of quotas versus carbon pricing: as Marty Weitzman pointed out, to the first-order effect, they're equivalent. If quotas were sold by governments, rather than granted freely, then they too might show the triple dividend discussed above.\r\n\r\nChris Hope and Nicholas Stern have tried to estimate the marginal damage costs of GHGs, and the uncertainties are high. So how high is high enough? Of the order of \u20ac120/tCO<sub>2</sub>e is enough to make onshore and offshore wind cheaper than gas or coal for electricity in windier parts of the world such as Britain (that would translate to about \u20ac0.11 extra on the cost of a kWh unit of electricity from coal, for example). It's enough to make PV cheaper than coal in sunnier parts of the world. Those who've been studying capture of ambient CO<sub>2</sub> and long-term stable storage, such as Klaus Lackner, have estimated an initial price of around \u20ac150/tCO<sub>2</sub>. So, somewhere in that range (\u20ac120-150/tCO<sub>2</sub>e) is probably, for now, a good estimate of the right price for GHGs. That's quite a lot higher than most carbon pricing being considered at the moment.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.passiv.de/English/PassiveH.HTM"}

How then to prioritise the most appropriate markets?\r\n\r\nIt depends on a number of factors:\r\n\r\n- **Who is doing the asking?** Investment banks are different from resource extractors are different from manufacturers and will have different requirements; governments seeking optimal economic policies have different objectives still.\r\n- **What constitutes \"success\"?** What is a good set of indicators (or proxies, if those indicators aren't available without costly primary research) which reflects your definition? A good place to start is with this question: [What are the most useful sources of economics data?][1]\r\n- **How stable does this rating need to be?**\r\n\r\nHere are a list of different league tables all useful in establishing different aspects of competitiveness:\r\n\r\n- [Doing Business][2] - World Bank and IFC league tables; very good\r\n- [Index of Economic Freedom][3] - Heritage Foundation\r\n- [Press Freedom Index][4] - Reporters Without Borders\r\n- [Corruption Perceptions Index][5] - Transparency International\r\n- [Whyqd][6] - disclosure, I wrote this and it is a work-in-progress, but it is a data search-engine which permits you to select any combination of factors and create your own ratings;\r\n\r\nAnd that's just a small sample of the range and variety of global league tables out there.\r\n\r\nBut consider some of the factors that make a country interesting which have nothing to do with finance or even economics:\r\n\r\n- **Population size:** neither of India or China would be viable investment destinations, given their terrible legal and social problems, if it weren't for their tremendous populations;\r\n- **Proximity:** Singapore, Hong Kong are tremendously open and free economies but tiny as local market plays.  It is their proximity to other giants AND their benevolent business environments which make them interesting.  Mauritius, just as open, is too far away.\r\n\r\nAll of which is to indicate that measuring competitiveness can be rather more complex than simply getting a sovereign rating from S&P, Moodeys or Fitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/179/what-are-the-most-useful-sources-of-economics-data/\r\n  [2]: http://www.doingbusiness.org/\r\n  [3]: http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking.aspx\r\n  [4]: http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2011-2012,1043.html\r\n  [5]: http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi\r\n  [6]: http://www.whyqd.com/"}

You raise a valid point about spatial aggregation, and we all sometimes forget exactly what averages mean (or mean averages), especially when we undertake regression analyses. \r\n\r\nBut, **the problem isn't entirely ignored--we often are at least as concerned with measures of dispersion as with measures of central tendency**. For example, economists put a good bit of focus on the distribution of income.  In development economics, we very often consider that income varies across not only over space, but also by gender, landholder status, race and so on.  We not only break income down by sub-national boundaries, but we also estimate median household income separately for female-headed households vs male-headed households (and broken down by a variety of other factors). But all that wouldn't fit on the back page of *The Economist*, and would require quite a bit of local knowledge to interpret.\r\n\r\nThis is a sub-case of what's known in geography as the modifiable areal unit problem.  The ways we aggregate spatial data matter, and we can re-aggregate spatial data in different ways to get almost any result we desire.  For many purposes, **country boundaries are at least as good as any other boundaries since country boundaries usually delineate an area with a common language, history, currency and political regime, thus implicitly controlling for many factors.**  That is, country boundaries are not nearly as arbitrary as are most sub-national geopolitical boundaries.   Thus, countries remain the basic unit of analysis for many analyses.  Trade flows are measured at the country level (for good reasons), and monetary (and other) policy is often determined at the country level (also for good reasons). \r\n\r\nPerhaps you are objecting to summary statistics in general?  Your argument could be carried forward until we require a table of the income of each person on earth.  Consider that there are large income differences even in eastern Chinese provinces--maybe we'd do better to just compare Guangdong with the rest of the world since Jiangxi is bringing down the eastern average.  For the same reasons, we should knock Mississippi out of the U.S. statistics and Wales out of the UK stats. We'd eventually find that Washington, DC is the most developed region on earth.  But the NW part of the city is very different from the SE part.  We could go on to require postal code and finally household data.  I suppose we could then say that my medical doctor neighbor is more developed than I am.  (Admittedly a bit of a straw man argument.)\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

It seems to me that your uncertainty is whether enough buyers or bids will appear.\r\n\r\nIt also seems to me that your critical mass (minimum number of bids daily required to ensure that the total number of transactions rises over time) will be lower, the more you facilitate the existence of a successful match.

How would set the interest rate for customers who want to borrow money?  One of the factors would be how much money your bank has available to lend.  If you have a substantial amount of reserves (i.e. customers making deposits by **saving** money) then you would charge a lower interest rate.  The interest rate depends on how much people save.  People have to save money first before anyone is able to borrow money.  Another factor is the demand for loans from customers.  When a lot of customers start requesting loans you will raise your rate.  Thus, the interest rate is the price of borrowing money where the price is determined by supply and demand: supply being savings and demand being the amount of customers demanding loans.\r\n\r\nThis is how the interest rate is determined in a free market.  Having an entity, such as the FED, arbitrarily set interest rates distorts the free market price mechanism for borrowing.  The interest rate is usually set artificially low to stimulate the economy.  This causes people to take loans that would have not been possible in a free market system.  This temporarily increases economic activity as people spend the borrowed money.  But this is not sustainable since the interest rate was not set by the market.  The low interest rate was artificial and gave the illusion of savings.  The bust occurs when the borrowing starts to slow at the given rate.\r\n\r\nThe FED controls the interest rate through two main factors: the reserve ratio and the federal funds rate.  The FED specifies the minimum amount of reserves a bank must have on hand.  Banks can loan money until they hit the reserve ratio.  The federal funds rate is the overnight interest rate at which member banks can borrow from the FED.\r\n\r\nI agree with the other poster who suggested reading a college economics textbook first.  After that thoroughly confuses you then read about Austrian economics which explains the above.

The real interest rate at time $t$, $r_t$ is simply the opportunity cost of capital.\r\n\r\nCentral banks use monetary policy to influence the performance of the macroeconomy in the short run. If a central bank lowers nominal interest ($i$) rates too much then it encounters the zero-bound problem, whereby nominal interest rates ($i$) cannot be lower than 0. Because of this, the central bank can be forced into non-orthodox measure such as Quantitative Easing and other large-scale asset purchases. In Europe, to lower the rates that sovereigns pay on their public debt, the European Central Bank is now buying up bonds. By adding to the weak demand for public debt in Europe, it hopes to increase prices and thereby lower interest rates. Remember that because these bonds are sold at discount (below par), there is an inverse relationship between the price and the interest rate.\r\n\r\nA low real interest rate ($r_t$) will cause overindebtedness, leverage and speculative bubbles. According to many economists such as Robert Shiller (author of Irrational Exuberance), it was precisely due to a period of very low interest rates following the tech bust that the US housing boom was born. Also, in Europe, because of the euro which lowered real interest rates in many countries, a binge followed. Now many countries there (namely the PIGS, i.e, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain) are forced to deleverage, i.e. to lower their levels of debt. Austerity measures are underway precisely to reduce excessive levels of public and private indebtedness.\r\n  "}

If such occurs then it is likely that the growth rate in the future be higher. This, in a nutshell, is Joseph Schumpeter's argument in favor of what he called Creative Destruction.\r\n\r\nIn short, what matters most (according to the work of Nobel laureate Robert Lucas in his work Understanding Business Cycles, and the Welfare Cost of Business Cycles) is growth. The media tend to obsess with unemployment, downturns and the like, but in terms of our personal welfare over the long run, economic growth trumps all. Using one of his most famous quotes, and paraphrasing a little, \"Once one starts to think about economic growth, it is vcery hard to think about anything else.\".\r\n\r\nThat is why economists should give such a major importance to structural reforms, that aim to make the performance of the macroeconomy more robust, more efficient and more in tune with a more globalized economy. Note that in this line of reasoning microeconomic reforms such as ensuring more competition are crucial.\r\n\r\nIn short, it's not only the quantity of growth that matters, it's also the QUALITY of growth. China will probably reach this conclusion very soon with its oversized and underused real estate that has just been going to enable China to keep posting great GDP growth numbers year on year.\r\n\r\n\r\n "}

It's easy to think of people that appear to have more money than they need or want and others whose needs are not the result of laziness, less easy to determine whether the marginal rich person's bonus they worked really hard for is worth less to them than the marginal poor person's useful extra income they might have been able to earn had they tried.\r\n\r\nIn a market system, an optimal exchange takes place when both the buyer and the seller think they will be better off given the rules of the \"free\" market[1]. We don't have any measure of how much each party believes they have gained by (or whether they are deluded in their *ex ante* belief(s) ) but we know that the tradeoff has theoretically benefited both parties from their will to participate in trade at that price. *Non-market* redistribution implies that at least one party in the transaction believes that they will be a loser; otherwise, acting rationally, they would have been willing to agree to some form of investment loan. What economics doesn't offer, even at the extreme end of the spectrum, is any way to quantify whether unemployable person X's desire to eat the food they need to live is worth more than rich person Y's desire to increase the amount in their savings account by $1. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere *is* a welfare economics criterion for \"optimal\" redistribution - the Kador-Hicks efficiency criterion - which suggests that aggregate social welfare can be improved if redistribution would create enough wealth to pay back those that had their wealth confiscated and still come out ahead. In other words if assets are taken from those using them inefficiently and given to those able to use them more efficiently you reach a social optimum: generally regarded as implying a net welfare gain happens even if those whose wealth was redistributed away from them are never repaid. The problems with this are: \r\n\r\n(i) it's based on the calculation of hypothetical outcomes (what the person losing the wealth would have generated based on investments or purchases they *might* have made versus what the people the wealth is being transferred to will generate based on things they *might* buy or invest in); it's the estimation of a policymaker rather than the belief of the participants in the redistribution.\r\n\r\n(ii) if the Kaldor-Hicks optimum *could* be accurately estimated it would likely indicate allowing some unproductive people to live \"costs\" more than leaving someone who invests in productive enterprises to keep the money. There's a strong argument that this is ethically wrong even if is economically \"optimal\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]An market outcome in which a tax rate is announced in advance *is* a \"free\" market outcome: parties have agreed to the transaction in the knowledge that the government will take x% of income and redistribute it to someone else (Despite what passionate defenders of \"free markets\" might argue, confiscation or theft are quite different). Whether raising tax rates will discourage people from exchanging goods by so much that it decreases overall tax yields is another hypothetical question that ought to be considered when determining an optimal level of redistribution. Knowledge of responses to tax changes in other times/places make this easier to guesstimate than who \"needs\" how much redistribution."}

When the interest rate the central bank charges is positive, lowering it makes it cheaper for banks to obtain cash reserves when needed which means they can afford to loan out money to their customers at lower rates. They still want to make a profit on loaning out money though, which means charging a positive interest rate to end borrowers.\r\n\r\nCommercial banks will happily borrow as much money as the Fed is willing to lend them at negative interest rates, but they're never going to pass that on in the form of paying businesses and consumers to borrow from them. Without changing rules to compel banks to lend, commercial lenders' interest rates will never go below zero. \r\n\r\nYou *could* change the rules to allow the public and companies that aren't banks to borrow money from the central bank within certain limits, and offer them a negative interest rate, meaning anyone that doesn't borrow the full amount is an idiot. So here's a thought experiment along those lines\r\n\r\nAssuming the central bank / government want their money back (otherwise it's a subsidy not a loan), they'll need to ensure the interest rate on this consumer lending is variable - so it becomes positive in future - because no sane person would ever make repayments on a loan that gets smaller while they defer repaying. This means it'll start making sense for recipients to repay the loan in future once interest payments becom positive (or more specifically *higher than the rate of return people are able to get from investing the money*). Obviously, wealthier people paying attention to their finances will be able to do this as soon as it makes sense for them and uncreditworthy poorer people who used the loan to finance their day-to-day spending habits won't, because they'll have spent it and need to wait for their next few paychecks to come in to repay.\r\n\r\nPaying people to borrow money is essentially welfare, and non-bankrupt poorer people tending accumulate more of the repayments is essentially a highly regressive form of taxation. By giving people that didn't need short term cash a debt-free temporary loan and people that needed it a longer-term loan with accumulating debt attached it would probably qualify as the worst form of welfare ever[1]. \r\n\r\nWhat about the short term economic gains from the extra cash circulating? Well I'd guess, since it needs to be repaid, more people would look to invest their loan than consume it resulting in a sharp rise in investment far in excess of expected levels of future consumption. Which would mean a lot of cash chasing the same opportunities (a big asset bubble), and a big crash once interest rates on the government loan go up above zero and people try to cash out to pay it back.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]It might be less damaging for poor people who are using the cash to pay off existing debt at much higher interest rates. But it's probably not the best way of helping them either."}

As others have mentioned, you have assumed that agents are homogenous and have simple, smooth utility functions.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, you have not modeled the mechanism by which personal utility maximizing behavior causes global utility maximization. Although this is the central theme of introductory economics, you are suggesting a more sophisticated model may exist that accounts for differences in personal utility functions. I believe that the optimal amount and method of wealth or income redistribution depends on the mix of utility functions in the economy and the mix of externality effects of individual actions, which in turn depends on technology.\r\n\r\nFor example, redistribution may be more important than in an economy where wealthy people love polluting than in an economy where wealthy people love to protect nature."}

Part of my job is to maintain software and formulas that calculate costs and selling prices. The way it is done now really bothers me.

And then the company says \"Ok, we want to take 25% of the selling price as profit\" where profit retains the original definition of profit = revenue - cost. To compute the selling price, this formula is used: selling price = [final cost]/75*100.\r\n\r\nA mathematical conseqeunce of this method is that if multiple profit sharing participants e.g. agent, sub-contractor etc. The total % cannot exceed 100% i.e. the significance of the 25% is merely a sell-price-split ratio. Furthermore, there seems not to be any scientific approach to determining how much % or ratio to allocate to cost, since it can arbitarily by 1%, 0.1%, 2.3% or anything left over after the split.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I cannot understand how cost analysis can be done if we calculate in this manner.\r\n\r\nAnyone can advice whether this method of managing sales revenue is fine?

Does that mean that banks are quite safer than eg Germany that borrows at about 3% ?\r\n 2. The role of banks: is there some kind of justification (banks as intermediate between ECB and Countries) because it forces countries to go to a \"market\" which evaluates they solvency and requires adequate interest rate (that would be the added value of banks and other lenders).\r\n\r\nEDIT -- after @psatek answer, to clarify my question :  \r\nMy question aims at understanding some basic aspects, not to grasp the full picture or assessing if it's good or bad that ECB does not lend to countries directly.  \r\nFirst aspects is : does ECB lending to banks involves risk assessment of the banks ?\r\nSecond aspect is : is there some purpose behind it like \"let the market assess solvency of countries\" ?

An economist would say that the best price is the one your customer is still willing to pay (if you have a specific customer in mind), or the price which maximizes the profits you can make depending on the market and your production capacities. If you are facing a competitive market, arbitrarily decided fixed overhead will most definitely not maximize your profits.

I can imagine two possible routes:\r\n\r\nFirst, the central bank could maintain the exchange rate by printing lots of its currency. In effect, the central banks prints new money and uses it to buy the gold or oil from the government. Incomes would rise internally due to the tax cuts. I guess prices would rise, but not by as much. (Remember, there must be a higher standard of living due to the gold or oil, and therefore the incomes-to-prices ratio must increase.) Preexisting debts would, in effect, be made smaller. I guess this is the most 'inflation-like' scenario, but is it a bad thing? The central bank's balance sheet is in good shape with all the gold and oil.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the central bank might not turn on the printing presses and the government would instead have to buy up its own currency and use this to fund the tax cuts and spending increases. On the international exchange markets the value of the currency would soar. In theory, the incomes-to-prices ratio should still increase, but I suspect this is a more 'deflation-like' scenario as prices might fall due to the great demand for currency by the state. If a truly huge amount of gold was found, the government might buy up all existing currency and still have some gold left over!\r\n\r\nIn such a scenario, should the central bank print the money or not? Should its target be to maintain the existing exchange rates, or to maintain the internal prices? I suspect that it's natural to allow internal prices to rise in this case, as the rises are due to the people becoming more affluent and lazy, and is not a symptom of a badly-managed currency."}

But please, correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nSo given that, one important detail is that all recessions are not equal. Some bubbles bursting can have only small effects on the society overall. I do feel that government intervention helped with the dotcom bubble, but that was a small sector of society with a lot of investment. It didn't have the possible span of the the housing bubble. Basically, are we looking at a short or long recession. Is a double-dip likely? Are we facing a liquidity trap? If it's a small recession, then it will likely clear out the weaker businesses and consumers can feel more confident in the surviving businesses (think about the oh-so-pointless websites in the dotcom era). However, if it is severe enough to result in a vicious cycle of high unemployment, low consumption such as the Great Depression, then it will likely not result in anything good. In fact, it can hold an economy back from prosperity that it would otherwise be capable of achieving. \r\n\r\nHowever, I see no evidence that these are controllable aspects of a recession. Rather, these are characteristics of the cause, and for that reason aren't really exploitable. Good things can certainly arise from a recession, but getting a good case of chicken pox when young can also make sure you don't get a deadly case when older. Still it might be better to never have to deal with chicken pox at all. And many of the 'benefits' of a recession can likely occur without the recession. "}

The premise is that the principal cannot exactly observe how much effort has been exerted, but can only observe say the (noisy) outcome of the action.\r\n\r\nTo go back to your example, the hospital manager would like the purchasing manager to invest effort in finding out the cheapest supplies of inputs, but can only observe how much was spent. The purchasing manager can always claim that this year was a bad year, and that it's not its fault.\r\n\r\nThe question then is for the principal to design a contract that will provide at least partial incentives for the agent to exert effort. Given the imperfect observability (or contractibility) of effort, the agent will then enjoy some informational rents. What this means is that **it is in general impossible for the principal to devise a contract that will induce the agent to exert the first-best level of effort**.\r\n\r\nThe problem becomes more acute when there are multiple tasks. (Look at [Holmstr\u00f6m-Milgrom 1991 paper][1] in JLEO). **When the results of tasks is not observed with the same precision in different tasks, incentive contracts will induce a distortion of effort towards more \"visible\" tasks, thereby also inducing sub-optimal allocation of effort.**\r\n\r\nAn extreme example is, say, if you reward class teachers on the basis how their students do in standardized tests. Then class teachers will have an incentive to exert more effort on training their students on those tests specifically, and less effort on stimulating general curiosity of the students (which is difficult to observe, or to contract on).\r\n\r\nThis should enable you to address the question, for example, of waiting time in hospitals versus quality of care. Waiting time can be very accurately measured, and rewarding that will distort effort away from less observable outcomes, such as quality of care.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://jleo.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/special_issue/24.full.pdf+html"}

Here are some more precise answers.\r\n\r\n> First aspects is : does ECB lending to banks involves risk assessment\r\n> of the banks ?\r\n\r\nI don't think it is possible to assess which bank will have failed in 3 years time and which will not.  However B\u00e2le III imposes higher \"Liquidity Coverage Ratio\" and \"Net Stable Funding Ratio\" which in theory would decrease the risks of bank default or at least firewall them.  And we all know that banks are currently doing all they can to collect savings and clean their balance sheets.\r\n\r\n>Second aspect is : is there some purpose behind it like \"let the market assess solvency >of countries\" ?\r\n\r\nIn effect, the banks are part of \"the market\".  And they do assess the risks. This is why there is still a spread between German rates and French or Spanish rates.  The fact that the ECB has stepped in merely tended to dispel the irrationality factor (general defiance between banks => credit crunch) which would have smothered the real economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm just a geek.

There are many company who have not paid a single divident or are not expected to pay dividents in the near future. That's why there are other models such as Discounted Cash Flow Model, which says that the stock's price is the discounted sum of all it's future cash flows. As with the Dividend Discount Model, it has its own disadvantages. One of them is that it uses a constant discount rate, which in real life obviously changes all the time.\r\n\r\nIn short, I don't think it's true to assume that if you buy a share of all publicly traded stocks now, you'll get more in 50 years. One of the reasons is that not all companies will exist 50 years from now (I believe the term is survivorship bias). The ones that do should cover for the losses you incurred from others that don't.

Thank you for your valuable input. \r\n\r\nThe reason why I used DDM is because I want to use a model as simple as possible (but not too simple) with assumptions that will not distortion the concept of the stock pricing. The cash flow model is useful if analyzed in the SHORT-MEDIUM outlook. I think we will both agree that nobody buys a piece of stock from a company and HOLD IT FOREVER if it SURELY knows that it will never bring any profit (revenue-costs). IF you held some stocks that u knew would never bring any profit you would want to sell it rather than hold it because you would expect nobody would want to buy it. This will drive the price of stock to zero. So stockholders of any company must have expectations of some kind of profit (even if it is purely speculative)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother reason why I used the DDM is because we treated the CONCEPT of price formation in the LONG RUN and this model also ASSUMES the company will still exist. If you knew with a 100% probability that the company will bankrupt in a future point in time before any dividents are paid and if we assume you won't get any assets left over after giving out debts, thne the stock you hold values 0$ and 0 cents.\r\n"}

I'm going to ask my Congressman to insert a provision in the tax code that would allow any asset used by telecommuters (I have a definition) to be accelerated at faster rate (the tax code divides assets into classes, I'm just going to suggest \"class - 1\").  This would hopefully encourage employers to allow telecommute, without forcing the issue.\r\n\r\nIn talking to my Congressman, however, I want to make the point that over a 10 year budget cycle, this proposal is effectively revenue neutral.

That's why there are other models such as Discounted Cash Flow Model, which says that the stock's price is the discounted sum of all it's future cash flows. As with the Dividend Discount Model, it has its own disadvantages. One of them is that it uses a constant discount rate, which in real life obviously changes all the time.\r\n\r\nIn short, I don't think it's true to assume that if you buy a share of all publicly traded stocks now, you'll get more in 50 years.

Risk, in economics, refers equally to the upside and the downside.  In this sense (possibly different from the common usage of the term) a possible -1 is no more risky than a possible +1.  It is not a case of an agent choosing a risky option that might lead to +1 but might also lead to -1, and preferring a certain 10.  The economic concept that is relevant, especially if 1 unit is large, is diminishing marginal utility.  However, before applying this here one other point needs clarification.\r\n\r\nNo employer or other authority can directly award, or take away, utility.  What they can perhaps do is award or withhold money or other benefits.  This will almost certainly affect agents' utility, but the precise effect depends on each individual (utility is often said to be subjective).  So the practical question for an employer or authority is not about utility but about a monetary or other reward or punishment.  And this is where diminishing marginal utility applies: if the monetary alternatives are say, 10,000 plus a possible reward of 1,000, and 10,000 minus a possible punishment of 1,000, most people's utility will be more affected by the difference between 9,000 and 10,000 than by that between 10,000 and 11,000. There are many online sources on diminishing marginal utility: \r\neg http://economicsconcepts.com/law_diminishing_marginal_utility.htm\r\n\r\nAlso relevant here are agents' expectations.  Incentives are often sequential or periodic rather than one-off.  If an agent expects income of 10,000 and has planned his/her outgoings accordingly, they will have a strong reason to try to avoid -1,000.  Equally, however, if in the past they have regularly performed well enough to achieve +1,000, they may have adjusted their outgoings so that they have a strong incentive to keep on achieving +1,000.\r\n\r\nFinally, from personal experience the presentation of incentive systems is extremely important.  Cultural and linguistic factors are likely to affect how systems are perceived.  To me at least, \"punishment\" suggests a response to wrongdoing, and if an authority attempts to punish me my reaction is likely to be to show that I have not done wrong.  If the issue is only under-performance, then some other terminology might be more appropriate, eg penalty.  Employment law in the UK at least would not allow an employer to make a deduction against a contracted salary on grounds of under-performance: hence employers who wish to offer monetary incentives have little choice but to adopt the reward option (with any punishments in other forms, eg formal warnings and ultimately dismissal).\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

It can often be difficult to maintain this rate due to inflation and finding more amounts of gold. Sometimes, people will want lots of gold instead of currency, and while the Treasury and Federal Reserve can find a way to print more money (they can't directly do it, but they can \"trade\" bonds for extra currency as part of policy), they cannot necessarily find more gold to exchange with buyers. At this point, a government may be forced to change the exchange rate of gold to currency and make gold more expensive. This will make people unhappy since it causes deflation of the currency, which can lead to disastrous results.\r\n\r\nA government does not have to wait for any particular moment to change the exchange rate, so this power can easily be abused. In wartime, trading often decreases, including trade of gold, which can lead to unstable rates. In any case, gold is not a solid basis for exchanging currency with. It's like when a small country tries to peg its currency to a larger country's currency, creating a generally stable exchange rate between the two currencies.

There is a large literature on the method.\r\n\r\nOne issue that I have not seen addressed in the literature is the distinction between marginal and other value concepts.  This may be because many published studies relate to remote sites, eg national parks.  However, if a city has many parks, and a value is estimated for one park, then it is surely important to be clear whether the value estimated represents:\r\n\r\na) the marginal value which that park contributes to the total value of all the city's parks, as compared to a situation without that park but with all the other parks still present, or\r\n\r\nb) a value which could, in principle, be added to the equivalent values for all the other parks to estimate the total value of all the city's parks (I avoid \"average value\" since an assumption of homogeneous units is implausible for parks).\r\n\r\nThe question is which of (a) or (b) would be estimated (however approximately) by a travel cost study of an urban park (or could a study be tailored to estimate whichever was desired)?  If, for example, the value was to be used in a cost-benefit analysis of a proposal to close one park for development, then it would presumably be important to have (a) rather than (b).\r\n\r\nThere are of course other important kinds of site value which the travel cost method does not capture (eg hedonic property value, the value of ecosystem services) - please ignore these for the purposes of this question."}

It is this accelerated depreciation that is the root cause of the cubicle, for instance. Because businesses can more quickly depreciate assets, they are able to realize tax gains more quickly, and sincer there is a time cost of money, make more profit. I'm going to ask my Congressman to insert a provision in the tax code that would allow any asset used by telecommuters (I have a definition) to be accelerated at faster rate (the tax code divides assets into classes, I'm just going to suggest \"class - 1\").  This would hopefully encourage employers to allow telecommute, without forcing the issue.\r\n\r\nIn talking to my Congressman, however, I want to make the point that over a 10 year budget cycle, this proposal is effectively revenue neutral. (Yes, you'd get some spillage for assets depreciated over a period longer than 10 years, but you get the idea.)\r\n\r\nAssuming, for example, that a $100 asset is taxed at 10%, I'm thinking that the total amount of tax collected on the asset is the same over the course of 10 years, regardless of whether it is depreciated over 5 years or 3.  - its just that with an accelerated depreciation, the tax is paid more quickly. \r\n\r\n**Ideally, I'd love to see a worked example that proves the point**\r\n\r\nIgnoring the time cost of money for the collected revenue (since the government doesn't invest the revenue), am I right?  Does depreciation just affect the rate at which tax is collected, but leaving the whole amount the same?"}

Please let me know of any other errors!\r\n\r\nIn a perfectly competitive market where there is no market power for the firm selling TVs, he/she will try to maximize profit. We can measure profit as\r\n\r\n$$\\pi = p(q)q - c(q)$$\r\nWhere $\\pi$ is profit, $p(q)$ is price in terms of quantity produced, and $c(q)$ is cost in terms of quantity produced. We have a market demand function that you gave\r\n$$q(p)=200,000-500p$$\r\nwhere $q(p)$ is a function of quantity demanded in terms of price. Since the firm is price taking in a competitive market, we can set $p(q)=p$. With this we create a profit equation, take the derivative, and set it equal to zero.\r\n$$\\pi = p*(200,000-500p) - c(q)$$\r\n$$=200,000p-500p^2 - c(q)$$\r\n$$\\frac {d\\pi} {dp} = 200,000 - 1,000p - 100 = 0$$\r\nThe derivative of $c(q)$ is marginal cost, which we know to be 100, and is why I put it into the equation. Solving for p we get $p = 199.9$. Substituting that back into the demand function you gave, we find $q=100,050$, which will be the number of TVs sold.\r\n\r\nNow to find what happens if we limit the TVs sold to 100,000. Plugging this into the demand function you gave, selling 100,000 TVs would increase the price to 200.\r\n\r\nWe know that $c'(q)=100$, so taking the anti-derivative of this gives us $c(q)=100q$. The original cost of production would have thus been $100 * 100,050 = 10,005,000$. This falls down to $100*100,000 = 10,000,000$ for our new cost.\r\n\r\nAnd for social benefit, we measure the change in profit for our producer.\r\n$$New_\\pi=200,000*200 - 500 * 200^2 - 10,000,000 = 10,000,000$$\r\n$$Original_\\pi = 200,000*199.5 - 500 * 119.5^2 - 10,005,000= 22,754,875$$\r\n\r\nWhich is a pretty large change in profit for such a small change in price! While producer surplus falls though, consumer surplus increases slightly, and total surplus (consumer sur. + producer surplus) falls. If you want to find consumer surplus for each scenario and then find the difference between total surplus, then you can take an integral:\r\n$$\\int_0^{quant. supp.} \\! ((200,000 - 500p) - p) \\, \\mathrm{d} p$$\r\nTo which you insert each value of p that you need.\r\n$$Original_{CS}= 20,039,675.25$$\r\n$$New_{CS}=20,040,000$$"}

So my question is: is there any way for a government to make the real wages change or are they outside the control of policymakers?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_wage_scale"}

Some will be spent on coffee beans, but the rest will go on wages, taxes, rent, equipment and so on. So it's ceased to be a coffee-dollar at the time of transaction.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is something in what you've said. The [tag:behavioral-economics] tag here is absolutely spot on: and we must remember that although many of the concepts that behavioural economics analyses have been known to confidence tricksters / people in marketing for ages, they were outside the scope of classical economics, and have only been brought within the formal remit of the study of economics relatively recently.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick romp through some of the concepts I've come across that are congruent with what you're saying.\r\n\r\nWithin transport economics, there is sometimes discussion of a **travel budget** - a relatively stable pot of time and/or money that is allocated to a household's travel, that might get switched between different journeys, but is less likely to be switched to a non-travel use.\r\n\r\nThis is partly wrapped up in the idea of **satisficing**: that because finding the optimum incurs a transaction cost, it's actually optimal to settle for a near-optimal outcome, and that switching preferences only happens when a step-change is reached in external conditions. So, we get used to spending \u00a3X per week on food, \u00a3Y per week on travel, \u00a3Z per week on utility bills, because that's proved to be a reasonably viable allocation of our budget. And that ends up giving us a food budget, a travel budget and a utility budget that gets reinforced by habit.\r\n\r\nAnd there's the concept of **price anchoring**: when we're looking to estimate a number, we're very suggestible. Any context-specific number we hear, anchors our expectations around that number. So, if we're used to spending, say \u00a3100 on one software licence, that's what we expect the next software licence to cost. If someone wants to pitch software at us that's \u00a31000 for a licence, they need to re-anchor our expectations, and one way to do that is to portray their software as being in a very different category to the one we're used to buying from. That way, they can re-anchor the price expectation at a different level.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the **sunk cost fallacy**: once we've spent a lump of money on the car, then we tend to be happier to spend more money on maintaining the car and keeping it operating, so that we don't feel we're wasting the lump sum already spent on it.  This can end up with us throwing good money after bad: we make irrational sub-optimal decisions to pay high maintenance costs, even though the lump sum already paid is gone and may be only recoverable in very small part."}

My estimated consumer surplus seemed low, and I\u2019ve been considering why this might be.  This question relates to just one possible reason.\r\n\r\nWhere a valuation relates to a remote site, eg a national park (as many published studies do), it may be a reasonable assumption to treat the value of the site in isolation.  Where a park is one of many within a city, however, the interactions between the demands for visits to different parks can hardly be ignored.  The question therefore is what exactly is the meaning of the value of an urban park estimated by the travel cost method.  Is it:\r\n\r\na) The marginal value which that park contributes to the total value of all the city\u2019s parks, as compared with a situation without that park but with all the other parks still present; or\r\n\r\nb) A value which could, in principle, be added to the equivalent values for all the other parks to estimate the total value of all the city\u2019s parks (I avoid \u201caverage value\u201d since an assumption of homogeneous units is implausible for parks); or\r\n\r\nc) Neither of the above; or\r\n\r\nd) Does the meaning depend on the details of how the method is applied (eg the variables included in the trip-generating function)?\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think the answer can be (a) since, if the park had not existed, some of its visitors would instead have visited other parks within the city, choosing to make higher-cost trips or to visit parks with inferior characteristics.  Thus some of the consumer surplus a travel cost study of one park measures is not additional, but merely transferred from other parks.\r\n\r\nI also don\u2019t think the answer can be (b).  Some people may have a strong desire to visit a park, and if no alternative were available, might be willing to travel say 20 km to visit a park.  But if they live in a city where everyone is within 2 km of a park, their willingness to travel 20 km is never revealed by their behaviour.  Of course they might make much more frequent trips, but there is no particular reason to think that this would have the same effect on measured consumer surplus.\r\n\r\nMy provisional thinking is that the answer is (c).\r\n\r\nI have looked at many papers on the travel cost method but have not seen this issue addressed.  Some papers \u2013 eg Rosenthal D H 1987  The Necessity for Substitute Prices in Recreation Demand Analyses  American Journal of Agricultural Economics Vol 69 No 4 pp 828-837 \u2013 refer to the inclusion of variables for substitute sites in estimating a trip-generating function for a site. It is shown that omission of substitute price variables can result in a biased estimate of the trip-generating function and therefore of a site\u2019s value.  But this seems to be a separate point.  It concerns how potential visitors behave given a choice between two or more existing sites.  It does not address how visitors would have behaved if one or more of the sites had not existed.\r\n\r\nThere are of course other important kinds of site value which the travel cost method does not capture (eg hedonic property value, the value of ecosystem services) - please ignore these for the purposes of this question."}

So the **travel cost differential** is probably telling me something about **differential utility per unit time**.\r\n\r\nThis whole subject is fraught with complexities and confounding features, though. In particular, parks are often primarily social spaces, which means that the choice of park will be influenced by, among other things, the distribution of travel costs of the people I'm planning to meet.\r\n\r\nAnd that's before we get into the heap of confusion that arises as soon as we take into account that when people make trips to recreational distances, they'll sometimes choose a travel route that does not minimise cost, because the journey itself becomes part of the recreational activity.\r\n\r\n![gratuitous photo of Regent's Park][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/CZZsO.jpg"}

Now you can make assumptions about these measures to make your model as simple or complicated as you'd like.  To briefly explain how this works (I assume that the improvement will turn a congested roadway into a non-congested roadway):\r\n\r\n 1. Calculate the delay of each individual (or aggregate to some degree) in the transportation network.  This is the difference between the non-congested travel time and the actual travel time.\r\n 2. Determine a measure of the time valuation (value-of-time) of individuals (e.g. everyone has same valuation, businesspeople have greater valuation than commuters).\r\n 3. Multiply each individual's delay by her value-of-time.  This gives you a measure of the time-cost of their trip (versus a non-congested trip)\r\n 4. Sum the time-cost across the individuals in the area of interest.\r\n\r\nWith the total time-cost across the population, you now have the benefit in monetary terms.  To get the cost of the construction, you need to estimate this as well (probably from similar projects or perhaps a government entity has already calculated it).  Compare the construction cost to the total time-cost to determine the cost/benefit ratio.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of your approach will depend on your assumptions, but this is the process in a nutshell.  Like a previous poster stated, people write books about the assumptions you could use and methods to use (Look at literature in transportation planning and travel demand modeling)."}

I wanted to note that Jehle's micro text is considered a first-year graduate micro book, but not quite as intimidating as the classic [Mas-Colell][1] text. I think I actually prefer MAs-Colell -- if you're going to dive in, you might as well have the bible of micro on hand. \r\n\r\nDavid Romer is considered a very good upper-level-undergraduate / introductory first-year graduate text (although most PhD Econ programs use \"more intense\" texts such as [Ljungqvist and Sargent][2] or others, though not sure I'd recommend starting with those). I might add that Jeffrey Parker at Reed College has written an entire companion text for the Romer text, to ensure that a beginner can tackle the text and understand what is going on and what the current research. I **highly** recommend that if you want to self-study graduate macro, you should acquire Parker's notes as well. They are excellent and you'll learn a bit about \"what empirical research says\" about the models. Fantastic. \r\n\r\nEssentially, both those texts might be characterized by many as \"entirely reasonable entry-level graduate textbooks\" -- not impossible-outside-the-classroom intense, but still graduate-level. \r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, graduate-level textbooks may not actually be at all suitable for your purposes. What do you want to an entry-level \"economics in general\" book for? \r\n\r\nRegarding portfolio theories and applications, you might look into John Cochrane's work. His [Asset Pricing][3] book is very good for the theory behind a lot of financial economics. Check out his [webpage for his books][4] for a free chapter on portfolio theory from that book. Also look into his course notes posted in that area of the webpage.  Cochrane also wrote an excellent free intro book for time-series econometrics called \"Time Series for Macroeconomics and Finance\" -- google it and it will pop up. Not sure if that's what you want but it is a very good and free resource. \r\n\r\nOn the note of free/libre introductory econ texts, I've heard good things about [this open-source textbook][5] (for example from [here][6] -- thanks internet archive); you might check it out as a first pass. This is much more of the introductory level, but that isn't a bad thing. It all depends where you're coming from and where you want to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/Microeconomic-Theory-Andreu-Mas-Colell/dp/0195073401\r\n  [2]: http://www.amazon.com/Recursive-Macroeconomic-Theory-Lars-Ljungqvist/dp/0262194511\r\n  [3]: http://www.amazon.com/Asset-Pricing-John-H-Cochrane/dp/0691121370/\r\n  [4]: http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/index.htm#books\r\n  [5]: http://www.introecon.com/\r\n  [6]: http://web.archive.org/web/20080823215942/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-textbook18-2008aug18,0,1852522,full.story"}

Over much of this period, the U.S. maintained a fixed\r\n> dollar price for an ounce of gold, and prior to 1913 (indicated by a\r\n> vertical line on the graph) there was no Federal Reserve System. The\r\n> pre-Fed era was characterized by frequent episodes such as the Panic\r\n> of 1857, Panic of 1873, Panic of 1893, Panic of 1896, and Panic of\r\n> 1907 in which even the safest borrowers would suddenly find themselves\r\n> needing to pay a very high rate of interest. Those events were\r\n> associated with significant financial failures and business\r\n> contraction. After establishment of the Federal Reserve, the U.S.\r\n> short-term interest rate became much more stable and exhibited none of\r\n> the sudden spiking behavior that used to be so common.  ... \r\n> \r\n> Even so, one of the worst economic downturns in America's history came\r\n> on the Fed's watch in the form of the Great Depression of 1929-1933.\r\n> But it's worth emphasizing that the U.S. was still on the gold\r\n> standard through this period, with the price of gold fixed at $20.67\r\n> per ounce. ...\r\n> \r\n> One of the problems with the gold standard is that when the real value\r\n> of gold changes (as it does all the time) and the dollar price of an\r\n> ounce of gold is fixed (as it must be by definition under a gold\r\n> standard), that means dollar prices have to adjust in response to\r\n> anything that happens to the gold market. With the economic and\r\n> financial turbulence of the late 1920s and early 1930s, there was a\r\n> big increase in the relative price of gold.\r\n> \r\n> ... Another indication that the gold standard and its attendant overall\r\n> dollar price deflation were making our problems worse is the fact that\r\n> the U.S. recovery began more or less immediately with the elimination\r\n> in 1933 of the legal convertibility of dollars to gold at the price of\r\n> $20.67. And our experience was not unique. The 14 countries that\r\n> decided to abandon the gold standard two years earlier than the U.S.\r\n> began their economic recovery in 1932, as seen in the top panel of the\r\n> figure below. Countries that stayed on gold, by contrast, experienced\r\n> an average output decline of 15% in 1932.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2012/02/why_not_abolish.html\r\n  [2]: http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/05/what_if_wed_bee.html\r\n  [3]: http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/12/the_gold_standa.html"}

For each land plot and each citizen, I pick at a random number that stands for the subjective utility of that specific land to that specific citizen.\r\n\r\n B. Additionally, for each citizen, I calculate a global utility, that depends only on the number of plots he holds. I assume it is a concave function (such as: 1000*sqrt(num-of-plots)).\r\n\r\n C. The total utility of a citizen is the sum of subjective utilities for all the lands he holds (A), and the utility that depends on the number of plots (B).\r\n\r\n D.

This is the maximum number of gold-ounces he will give for this land.\r\n\r\n F. The current holder of that land also compares his current utility with the utility he will have without this plot. This is the minimum number of gold-ounces he will demand for selling this land.\r\n\r\n G. If E is greater than F, then there is a deal. The price is chosen at random between E and F. The buyer pays the gold-ounces to the seller.\r\n\r\nDoes this model makes sense?\r\n\r\nCan you point me to papers with similar models?"}

However, it is a fallacy to argue that if the production and consumption quantities of a commodity have not changed significantly then a large increase in its price must be due to speculation.  All that can be inferred is that supply and/or demand have shifted so that the curves intersect at a similar quantity but at a different price (I ignore here complications arising from the possibility of holding stocks).  It could be that:\r\n\r\n1. The supply curve has shifted upwards, and demand is inelastic.\r\n\r\n2. The demand curve has shifted upwards, and supply is inelastic.\r\n\r\n3. Both the supply and the demand curves have shifted upwards.\r\n\r\nIn each case the shift(s) could be due to non-speculative reasons.  For supply these could be increases in extraction costs, or disruption due to political circumstances, For demand they could be increased incomes or reduced supply of substitutes.\r\n\r\nIt should also be borne in mind that the actors in a market cannot be neatly divided into speculators and what might be termed \"normal traders\".  An oil-producing country with finite reserves, deciding how much to extract in a given year can hardly avoid taking into account its view of how oil prices might change in future years.  The [Hotelling Model]( http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/hotelling-theory-price-oil.asp#axzz1ocfq29mb), though it has been criticised,gives some insight into the economic considerations that might drive such a country's extraction policy.

I can make a lot more shoes than I can use. With barter it would be difficult for me to purchase a car with my extra shoes since the person making cars would not be interested in owning hundreds of pairs of shoes in exchange for a car. So instead, I look for a good that is desired by everyone and easily traded. A good that is always desired and easily traded (i.e. highly liquid) is a good candidate for money.\r\n - Durability - Once I've traded my extra shoes for money, I want a money that is durable so I do not have to spend it right away and I can accumulate it for larger purchases. This is why cattle and grains are not ideal forms of money.\r\n - Divisible - The car maker wants to be able to receive something in payment that he can divide so that he can purchase smaller items like my shoes. The item chosen for money must be easily divisible into smaller units.\r\n - Easily recognizable - People should be able to recognize the money as genuine and easily spot counterfeit money. Years ago this was a problem with paper money.\r\n - Easily transportable - People want to be able to walk into a store, shop, and purchase items with money they can carry on them.\r\n\r\nHistorically gold and silver have met the criteria for all of the above and thus, have always proved to work well as money.\r\n\r\nThe government can turn paper into money by accepting the paper for payment of taxes.  Also, government can enact legal tender laws where the creditor must accept the government paper money for payment of debts.  Gresham's law comes into effect once the paper money enters the economy.  Gresham's law is summarized as \"bad money drives out good money\".  People will always trade their lowest quality money first so the lower quality money drives out the higher quality money.  Once paper money appears, hard money (gold, silver, and copper) will disappear as people prefer to pay with the paper money and creditors have to accept the paper money due to legal tender laws.\r\n\r\nNote that Gresham's law can drive gold and silver out of circulation also:\r\n\r\nThe Coinage Act of 1792 established the US dollar as 371.25 grains of silver or 24.75 grains of gold. This established a government ratio of 15 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold. In the late 18th century there was a large production of silver from Mexico and the market ratio of silver to gold increased to 15.75 to 1 by 1805. The government ratio, however, was still 15 to 1. This was enough incentive for people to exchange their silver coins for gold coins at the government ratio, melt the gold, and sell the gold bullion overseas at the market value. Thus, gold coins disappeared from circulation as people either hoarded the gold or sent it abroad. People used the overvalued silver coins (i.e. the \"bad\" money) domestically and gold coins disappeared from the market.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to correct the problem of disappearing gold coins the Coinage Act of 1834 was enacted. It kept the US dollar at 371.25 grains of silver but changed the definition to 23.2 grains of gold which established a government ratio of 16 to 1. This was close to the market ratio of gold to silver at the time so both gold and silver coins appeared in circulation again. The gold rush of 1849 produced a lot of gold and the market ratio of silver to gold became 15.46 to 1. Now gold was overvalued so people began exchanging their gold coins for silver coins at the government ratio, melt the silver, and sell the silver bullion overseas at the market value. People used the overvalued gold coins (i.e. the \"bad\" money) domestically and silver coins disappeared from the market."}

And pegging simply means that China sets a fixed exchange rate, which currently is around 6.3 CHY per 1 USD.\r\nLet's take a look at a [plot of USD/CHY][1] exchange rate. From the graph we indeed can conclude that the Chinese Central Bank interferes in its foreign exchange rate policy HOWEVER the exchange RATE DECREASED (which means that the CNY increased in value from 2004 when it was traded at 8.3 CNY/USD for a long time. That's a 25% increase in the value which roughly translates into the imports from China being almost 25% more expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Policy implications:**\r\nArtificially devaluing the yuan, the Chinese make their goods less expensive (because we assume the wages and costs are in yuans) and this boosts the Chinese exports. When Exports > Imports then we get a positive Net exports and the result is that the Central Bank of China increases its reserves of foreign currency. Now China has the biggest reserves of foreign currency in the world(which is a sign they don't know what to do with the money they make), the total value of their reserves being 3.18 Trillion US Dollars. That's a long way from ONLY US /$ 1.6 bln (not trillion) back in 1978.  The reserves are impressing even on the per capita basis, if we consider that China has 1.2 bln ppl we get a sum of USD 2650. (That's almost like GERMANY USD 3212, and the German exports were until recently the highest in the world, the second being China) Here's an interesting [map of the value exports of countries][2], and here's the [reserves value][3] that countries have accumulated.\r\n\r\n**Consequences of pegging the exchange rate:**\r\nWhen a country pegs its currency it runs 2 risks: It can either: \r\n*OVERVALUE or \r\n*UNDERVALUE its currency. \r\n\r\nIf you Overvalue your currency (the case of Moldova in 1997) you soon end up depleting your reserves (and gold) and very likely defaulting on your international obligations with other undesirable consequences (it's interesting to take a look at the [evolution of Moldovan foreign reserves][4] ). \r\n\r\nIn the case of undervaluing your currency **YOU LOSE CONTROL OF YOUR MONEY SUPPLY** and therefore risk to create a higher than desirable inflation. \r\nOf course inflation depends on many factors: especially the excess production capacity or the availability of work force so it does not mean that by undervaluing your currency and pegging it you'll get huge inflation the next MONTH. \r\n\r\n*Hope it was somewhat useful and not too boring.* \r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=Linear&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1331369482886&chddm=2712144&q=CURRENCY:USDCNY&ntsp=0&authuser=0\r\n  [2]: http://www.indexmundi.com/map/?v=85\r\n  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign-exchange_reserves\r\n  [4]: http://www.nationmaster.com/time.php?stat=eco_tot_res_min_gol_cur_us&country=md"}

Will not the cost be exactly the same, and how can we show social benefit?\r\n\r\nI don't think this is very hard, but I'm just missing the foundations. Can somebody help me?"}

And pegging simply means that China sets a fixed exchange rate, which currently is around 6.3 CHY per 1 USD.\r\nLet's take a look at a [plot of USD/CHY][1] exchange rate. From the graph we indeed can conclude that the Chinese Central Bank interferes in its foreign exchange rate policy HOWEVER the exchange RATE DECREASED (which means that the CNY increased in value from 2004 when it was traded at 8.3 CNY/USD for a long time. That's a 25% increase in the value which roughly translates into the imports from China being almost 25% more expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Policy implications:**\r\nArtificially devaluing the yuan, the Chinese make their goods less expensive (because we assume the wages and costs are in yuans) and this boosts the Chinese exports. When Exports > Imports then we get a positive Net exports and the result is that the Central Bank of China increases its reserves of foreign currency. Now China has the biggest reserves of foreign currency in the world(which is a sign they don't know what to do with the money they make), the total value of their reserves being 3.18 Trillion US Dollars. That's a long way from ONLY US /$ 1.6 bln (not trillion) back in 1978.  The reserves are impressing even on the per capita basis, if we consider that China has 1.2 bln ppl we get a sum of USD 2650. (That's almost like GERMANY USD 3212, and the German exports were until recently the highest in the world, the second being China) Here's an interesting [map of the value exports of countries][2], and here's the [reserves value][3] that countries have accumulated.\r\n\r\n**Consequences of pegging the exchange rate:**\r\nWhen a country pegs its currency it runs 2 risks: It can either: \r\n*OVERVALUE or \r\n*UNDERVALUE its currency. \r\n\r\nIf you Overvalue your currency (the case of Moldova in 1997) you soon end up depleting your reserves (and gold) and very likely defaulting on your international obligations with other undesirable consequences (it's interesting to take a look at the [evolution of Moldovan foreign reserves][4] ). \r\n\r\nIn the case of undervaluing your currency **YOU LOSE CONTROL OF YOUR MONEY SUPPLY** and therefore risk to create a higher than desirable inflation. \r\nOf course inflation depends on many factors: especially the excess production capacity or the availability of work force so it does not mean that by undervaluing your currency and pegging it you'll get huge inflation the next MONTH. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=Linear&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1331369482886&chddm=2712144&q=CURRENCY:USDCNY&ntsp=0&authuser=0\r\n  [2]: http://www.indexmundi.com/map/?v=85\r\n  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign-exchange_reserves\r\n  [4]: http://www.nationmaster.com/time.php?stat=eco_tot_res_min_gol_cur_us&country=md"}

Likewise decreasing interest rates would tempt investors to pull currency out of a given market and invest their capital elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn a free market the value of a currency would be allowed to rise and fall. China is accused of not subjecting their currency to market conditions but rather pinning it to the US dollar. Specifically ensuring the yuan is relatively cheaper than the US dollar. \r\n\r\nSince the dollar has a much higher relative value than the yuan it's cheap to buy Chinese goods and services in US dollars. Likewise since the yuan has a low value relative to the dollar it's expensive buy US goods with the Chinese yuan.\r\n\r\nAll of this leads to a situation where the US imports more goods from China than it exports out to China.

By doing that, there is no further need to print money as there are no longer threats to their economy.\r\n\r\nBut, the problem is, that if they put a cap such that the Swiss Franc becomes too cheap, then there will be massive inflow of money, but this time it will not be to buy and hold the Swiss Franc, but to buy Swiss products.\r\nIf that where to happen the SNB should stop its policy right away, else prices will increase very quickly (inflation) as the SNB prints money to match the demand from foreign firms to buy Swiss products.\r\n\r\nWe have to keep in mind that the reason behind having floating currencies is because the rate of exchange of currencies can adjust itself very quickly when the whole economy behind it can't.\r\n\r\nFor example: Salaries are not adjusted of a daily basis and can remain too low while the inflation put the price higher, there exists contract that can fix prices of certain good a certain period, factories cannot be adjusted quickly to the new supply/demand, if money looses value to quickly then lending won't be done on long period, etc....\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to assess the inflation risk, you can monitor the Foreign reserve of the Swiss Cenral Bank (I think that you can find this information on their website). If the reserve is increasing very quickly, then there is a risk of inflation.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's my opinion and I can be wrong."}

Social Security's Average Wage Index?)\r\n - Inflation measure (CPI, but which one?)\r\n - Are there others that make sense?\r\n - Some hybrid of these, for example:\r\n   - Wage-based index on wage and contract labor spending\r\n   - Inflation measure on materials spending\r\n   - GDP or some tax-based measure on revenue\r\n\r\nDo you have suggestions about what indexes make sense or are commonly accepted?

Mandatory spending (also called Direct spending) is established by authorizing legislation and does not require annual appropriation legislation to allocate money.  Discretionary spending programs require appropriation legislation each year to allocate money to them.\r\n\r\nSo the answer is, \"Yes, income taxes pay for some mandatory legislation, but it's a bit more complicated than that.\" Mandatory programs are generally provided with a funding mechanism, such as the payroll tax associated with Social Security programs. However, as with the current situation with Medicare, some programs become underfunded despite a provided funding mechanism, and then usually rely on general funds to make up the difference. General fund money is comprised, for the most part, of income, corporate and excise taxes. Sometimes, Congress will pass reforms of mandatory programs which alter their funding mechanisms and remove the need for this.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in more detail on how these things work, the [budget *Analytical Perspectives* document][1] (albeit very long) has a chapter on \"Budget Concepts\" which may be helpful to you.  In addition, a text such as [Allen Schick's *The Federal Budget: Politics, Policy, Process*][2] is quite informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Analytical_Perspectives\r\n  [2]: http://www.amazon.com/The-Federal-Budget-Third-Edition/dp/0815777353/"}

The first point I will argue is that [CouchSurfing][1] (CS) is an example of crowd-sourcing impacting a capital-intensive industry but has realistic limits.\r\n\r\nCS allows people to \"host\" traveling strangers on their couch, and no payment is exchanged.  The exact reason they do this is complicated, but the act of traveling itself has a high social status associated with it (look at any site where people post self-descriptions and you will find many mentions), and the act of hosting is taken as a worldly thing to do that enables other travelers while also increasing the world knowledge of the host themselves.  Also, hosting people makes it more likely that you will *get* hosted by other people, since the profiles prominently display references from previous hosts and travelers.  In this way, a pay-it-forward system is self-enforcing because anyone can evaluate on their own whether or not the traveler has contributed enough to the community to justify their generosity.  People use CS as an alternative to hotels.  Hotels require staffing, but the cost composition is mostly in the capital cost of the real estate.  The industry, as a whole is uniformly denied revenue by the existence of CS.  The value that CS provides, of course, wasn't created from nothing, but it did come from the under-utilization of real estate assets.\r\n\r\nThis last argument isn't unique to CS.  While CS has been growing since 2006, [Airbnb][2] is a for-profit company that emerged in late 2009.  The rules of Airbnb are similar to CS (peer-to-peer, references, mentality) but hosts receive a payment.  Here is a quick Google Trends comparison (which doesn't reflect usage directly).\r\n\r\n - Red - Airbnb\r\n - Blue - CouchSurfing\r\n\r\n![comparison][3]\r\n\r\nNow, both of these are \"crowd sourced\", but one of them is completely free and one of them is not.  That is to say, the non-free option emerged as an alternative to the free option.  My guess, however, is that Airbnb didn't detract from the usage rate of CS, but instead took more business from the hotel industry (which is still probably large in comparison).\r\n\r\nFor one last example of **capital efficiency**, look at one of the most common examples given by advocates of collaborative consumption.  [They say that a power drill is only used a few minutes in its lifetime, so sharing it is dramatically more efficient][4].  In order for us to make economic sense of this all, we must speak of **value**.  The proposition is that the value of the power tool is the use of the tool (and not the ownership of it).  In that sense, increasing capital efficiency has increased the value we have access to.  In a more dubious sense, we may say it allows us to consume more with higher efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe example of [Swap Tree][5] is an extreme example because it is so heavily oriented around trading media items, including DVDs and books.  Media can already be traded at almost no cost between consumers, which is a story we've seen before.  In that case, the production of intellectual products is almost completely disconnected with the cost to consume them.  Capital has argued that they need protection from this trading.  Developers of video game have complained about used game trading because it reduces demand for their product.  You are probably familiar with a similar infamous fight the recording industry waged.  Ultimately, the same argument can (and might) be made regarding power tools.\r\n\r\ncapital changes\r\n-----------------\r\nThis is easier to argue than the case of labor.  Ultimately it's the total demand that gets squeezed, but the effect is seen sharply by capital because capital represents an asset that has already been invested in and can decrease in value as a result of sharing and crowdsourcing tools.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the argument is that people now have greater purchasing power - they can consume more.  This would then increase demand elsewhere.  Where?  Nobody knows, but it should bid up prices wherever that is temporarily, and expand those industries permanently long-term.\r\n\r\nThat is, unless people work less.\r\n\r\nlabor changes\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAn interesting reference to make is The Zeitgeist Movement, which vehemently argues that **technological unemployment** is a major problem.  They go on to argue that a different economic system is needed to accommodate the dramatic efficiency gains to come.  A careful reading of the crowdsourcing projects shows that technology plays a large part in their existence and usefulness.  Wikipedia, for instance, could not have existed before the wiki software was developed.  On another less trivial level, CouchSurfing itself would be dramatically more difficult without the existence of mobile communication and computing devices (which coincided with its rise).  It may be useful to look at this as a balance between technology and labor in the long term.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that technological unemployment is a complete myth.  With greater means, people will likely consume more, in fact, that is inevitable.  This may not be true, however, if they work less.  Are all the hours spent on Wikipedia hours that would otherwise be spent on leisure?  I doubt it is either 100% leisure of work time that is sacrificed.  I think we would be looking at a model where people:\r\n\r\n - Consume more\r\n - Consume at higher efficiency\r\n - Work less\r\n - Spend time \"contributing\" which takes away from both other leisure and work\r\n\r\nAside from the last point, I think these are characteristic of any gain in affluence, although whether or not such gains collapse labor markets is still an open question.  As to whether crowdsourcing can collapse **a** labor market, I think the answer is clearly that it can.  In terms of the total labor market, it depends on your view of technological unemployment.  That is, unless you believe crowsourcing can solve that problem as well.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.couchsurfing.org/\r\n  [2]: http://www.airbnb.com/\r\n  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/L8Gsr.png\r\n  [4]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQa3kUJPEko\r\n  [5]: http://market.swap.com/"}

But crowd-sourcing by definition needs a crowd to source from. Voluntary activity can often have, as its own reward, the building of a direct link between volunteer and beneficiary. Whereas within crowd-sourcing, there is a much greater gap between volunteer and beneficiary. For example, it's unlikely that I'll ever meet more than one or two of the people whose questions I've answered on StackExchange. So, the reward/motivation (accepting that those are two subtly different things) must be coming from somewhere else. \r\n\r\n1) Does crowd-sourcing require a network effect?\r\n----\r\n\r\n***TL;DR Not necessarily, but they do often go together***. It is possible to find crowd-sourcing without network effects - for example some charitable fund-raising - that's a type of crowd-sourcing that (I expect) long pre-dates the coining of the term \"crowd-sourcing\".  But crowd-sourcing as applied to other activities does tend to go hand-in-hand with network effects. The very infrastructure that enables crowd-sourcing, also enables things like:\r\n\r\n - construction of avatars (in the broader sense of a dedicated additional identity, rather than in the narrow sense of a graphical icon);\r\n - linking of those avatars to individual specific contributions\r\n - accumulation of a quantitative or qualitative indicator of domain-specific contribution (reputation, experience points, karma points, achievement badges, etc)\r\n\r\nAnd all of those things help establish network effects. So, although crowd-sourcing doesn't need network effects in play directly, it certainly can help.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Does crowd-sourcing collapse a labour market?\r\n----\r\n\r\n***TL; DR It can. Or it can create new employment markets.*** In theory, crowd-sourcing should open up new economic efficiencies, leading to a greater economic benefit on the whole (though not necessarily to all). It can result in structural changes (e.g. as mentioned in another answer, stock photography), and, like any structural change, that can result in some kind of structural job-losses.  In the long run, it will lead to greater net social welfare, but as to where those benefits accrue, that's a political decision.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it may be that an industry grows from something that had only been of very very minor economic value previously, so it is conceivable that crowd-sourcing can create net new jobs. For example, protein-folding was never a big source of employment. And yet sites such as [fold-it][1] have allowed the execution of what is typically (but not exclusively) very low economic-value work; and the fold-it site itself requires staff to run it, and once in a rare while, the new knowledge obtained will result in new products and new employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://fold.it/"}

If you consider that a large part of prices are due to local inputs, then the consumer is the same people as the producer to a large extent.  If wages are uniformly higher, then a retail location has to pay their staff more.\r\n\r\nThus, I think one of the few useful mechanisms to explain lower prices in Germany is **efficiency**, which is the result of a myriad of factors.

Consider reading [my blog post][1] to clear my point.\r\n\r\nA deflation may seem like a good thing in the eye of an average consumer, it can lead to collapse of any economy to the ground. As most economists say a hyper-inflation is always better than deflation, because deflation is almost impossible to control unlike hyper-inflation. For example, interest rates can be decreased, but there's a limit to it, you can't have negative interest rates.  \r\nThus it's important to avoid recession at all cost. Though sometimes it works as a buffer or generally a correction for next upward trend in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://abhishek347.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/inflation/"}

You would like to know things like \"the life expectancy of a certain population\", \"the income per capita in a nation\", \"the girl child education rate\" and many other statistical indicators.

In other words, statistics/econometrics is a tool that helps to understand demography.\r\n\r\n(ii) \"Are there lots of stochastic processes involved in demography?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer is a BIG YES. Remember, the definition states that demography is a \"social science\", which means that it is directly related to humans. As you may have noticed, studying humans is a very complex task and there are definitely plenty of things we can't scientifically observe in the human nature. These unobserved things are the \"stochastic processes\" you are asking about. For example, one may ask: \"What are the factors that determine a person's happiness?\". Some possible answers maybe: \"the level of income\", \"the amount of leisure time\", \"the number of children (maybe, lol)\" and \"the rule of democracy in the country\". These are elements that certainly can be quantified with relative ease (as far as the rule of democracy is concerned, there exist some indices). However, there are a lot of determinants of a person's happiness that may not be easily quantifiable. Some examples are: \"the quality of the food where the person lives\", \"the kindness of the person's neighbors\", \"the kindness of the person's colleagues at his work place\", etc. Therefore, these are stochastic.\r\n\r\nHope I have been able to help."}

Hence, just maxing out their GDP will not be the utility function.\r\n\r\nNote: If countries have utilities function, we run into some issues. Some countries, like Turkey or Nazi Germany prosecuted their richest minority (armenians, jews). Does that mean genocide serve the country's best interest?\r\n\r\nIf utility function is defined as what ever correctly predict the countries' behavior, then the answer is yes. Moreover, if utility function is defined as the objects' best interest, then yes it's to the best interest of most countries to prosecute their richest smartest minority. This lead to a really bizarre and politically incorrect conclusion that holocaust actually serve Germans' best interest because that's exactly what they did.\r\n\r\nAnother way to reach the same conclusion is to observe that the countries' interests are pretty much its ruling class interests. The interest of the ruling classes are often served by scapegoating more successful minorities.\r\n\r\nAnother sample. So many countries complain about other countries dumping goods to them. Dumping goods hurt the interest of democratic countries because swing voters need job. So, even though the country economy is actually benefited by other countries dumping good, the whole country as a whole will behave differently."}

Let's say a person faces two choices first:\r\n\r\n>\"L\" = learning about the platforms of the two candidates\", with an associated expected payoff of 5\r\n\r\n>\"NL\" = not learn., with an expected payoff of 4\r\n\r\nSo he picks L.

In short it's a Pigouvian tax that aims to reduce a negative price externality: pollution associated to the use of goods and services with a carbon content. \r\n\r\nThe triple dividend that is normally referred to in the literature encompasses:\r\n\r\n - a green dividend - as emissions are reduced\r\n - a blue dividend - as carbon taxes provide tax revenue that, in a revenue-neutral setting, allow other, distortionary, taxes to be lowered, thus making the tax system more efficient; and \r\n - a third dividend that some consider to be a GDP or social welfare dividend, either linked to the idea of a more sustainable development, or simply having more income, or even (as I've recently seen) related to redistributional concerns.\r\n\r\nHow real are triple dividends in the empirical/applied economics literatures?\r\n\r\nMy fundamental quibble (or stumbling block) is that these goods and services with a carbon content (basically heating and transportation) have a very low price elasticity of demand (there are very few substitutes and they are essential goods anyway) so it seems that there won't be a reduction in emissions anyway. If not, what am I missing? I mean, with carbon taxes we'll probably just have another source of revenue (the economic incidence of which is unclear to me at this point) that will allow other tax margins to be alleviated and thus enable a more efficient tax system. But then we won't have a reduction in emissions ...\r\n\r\nBut isn't that the whole point of a carbon tax? I.e., to bring emissions down.\r\n\r\nPS - I know that the price elasticities of demand will be larger in the long run, but then it seems that the issue is simply one of discounting, i.e. trading off the present against the future.  \r\n\r\nIn short, what am I missing here from a conceptual viewpoint?\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax"}

The people who pay for the product or service (the donors) are not the people who receive the product/service.  This makes it difficult to assess how much it \"should\" cost to deliver these things.  Moral hazard comes into play as well; if no-one can tell then there is little incentive to improve and, often, an opportunity to be a bit \"wasteful\".\r\n\r\nA project I ran in South Africa looked at rating individual NPOs relative to each other for a fixed basket of services.  One of the ones we selected was the care of AIDS orphans.  The variance in cost per child was large and, as you've mentioned in your question, much of the difference was down to administration and the cost of fundraising.\r\n\r\nComparisons and ratings do help to create transparency, but the pressure to improve efficiency will only follow if donors choose to give their money only to well-rated agencies.\r\n\r\nIn the US [Charity Navigator][1] rates charities.  [Guidestar][2] rates in the UK and a few other countries.  There are others, but be aware that many \"ratings\" agencies are actually fund-raisers in disguise and contribute to those high above-the-line costs.\r\n\r\nThese are all voluntary ratings.  It would be helpful if NPOs looking to raise funds were rated independently much as bond-sellers are required to do.\r\n\r\nUntil then, the inefficiency is exactly as one would expect in such a market.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.charitynavigator.org/\r\n  [2]: http://www.guidestar.org.uk/"}

Imagine a coal\r\nminer who gets paid with coal. Whenever he wants to buy anything,\r\nfirst he must find a person that has the item he wants *and* this very\r\nsame person has to want coal in order for the transaction to be\r\ncarried out. (This is called the problem of double coincidence of\r\nwants.) Because the miner is likely to have a hard time finding people\r\nto trade with, he will work less and produce less coal than he\r\notherwise would if he was paid with money. So, if money becomes very\r\nscarce, it could get to a point where trade becomes difficult and\r\nproduction levels fall. Something like this happened after World War\r\nII, when most European countries had run out of foreign reserves and\r\nthat prevented them from engaging in international trade and the\r\neconomy from recovering. \r\n\r\nSecond, money is a store of value. Deflation means that prices go down\r\nor, what is the same, that every unit of money can buy more as time\r\ngoes by. Therefore people may refrain from spending, in the hope that\r\nthey will be able to spend more in the future, because the purchasing\r\npower of money increases with time. So, it is conceivable that\r\ndeflation can reduce spending temporarily, although personally I\r\nhaven't got concrete evidence of this happening.\r\n\r\nThird, money is a unit of account. This means that prices are\r\nexpressed in units of money. If the amount of money relative to the\r\namount of goods and services varies, then all prices have to be\r\nadjusted accordingly. Now, some economists say that not all prices\r\nadjust at the same speed (the theory of \"sticky prices\"). For instance, we know that the price of oil\r\nchanges daily, whereas wages adjust at a much slower rate. If this\r\nhappens, it can make resources to be re-allocated according to the new\r\nrelative prices. Again, I can't think of any concrete example where\r\nthis effect has been measured."}

There's also a video version. The section on zero-overhead giving has some neat ideas and discussions of issues like the trade-off between overhead and evaluation. The cost of the fundraising dinner might look like a giant waste, but if it generates a stream of continuing donations over time, it might be a reasonable one to bear. Without evaluation, which is itself expensive overhead, we will never know.\r\n\r\nHere's a couple of other data points from [an experiment done by John List and his co-authors][2]. The found that lotteries were the most productive type of fundraising (both in terms of what fraction of approached people contributed and how much they contributed), compared to voluntary contributions with and without seed money. Lotteries have higher overhead since you have to give out prize money. They also found that the attractiveness of the female solicitor improved the success of fundraising, at least among the male donors (in participation decision). If you believe Daniel Hamermesh's results, attractive people earn more, so they would also cost more to hire.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that it takes a lot of human capital to run an organization capably. NPOs compete with the FPOs for this talent. Obviously someone might be willing to accept a smaller salary in order to spend their time helping people and there are non-pecuniary lifestyle considerations as well, but  NPOs have to absorb some of that opportunity cost to stay competitive. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I guess this is really an empirical issue. It it better to raise 100K with 80K in overhead or is it better to raise 10k with 1K overhead?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-04-06.html\r\n  [2]: http://www.nber.org/papers/w11611.pdf"}

If you're talking about the demands of players, it's probably (2), which is tricky since you don't have any data about game yet.\r\n\r\nIn any case, take a look at [Edward Castranova's book and papers.][1] I think he's the guy who knows the most about video game economics out there.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://mypage.iu.edu/~castro/home.html"}

Based on my approach, the exchange rate should be 10 RCCU to 1 PCCU. Now, we try to adjust for income: Say, the average monthly pay in the rich country is 1000 RCCU and 50 PCCU in the poor country. Then, the average income in eht rich country is 10 baskets and 5 baskets in the poor one. But: would that change the spot exchange rate?\r\n\r\nI would argue, that it should not change the spot exchange rate - a traveller from the rich country, taking 100 RCCU with him, gets 10 PCCU and can buy one basket. Why should the matter that he only works 1/2 the time for his income change anything with regard to the prices? Of course, if we open trade in goods (and would not only 1 person travel), this price relation would change as each country adjusts their production with respect to their relative advantages in production."}

This will lead to firms exiting the market until price equals average total costs.\r\n\r\n Why don't the firms exit the market en masse such that supply will drop to 0 and the market will no longer exist?\r\n\r\n My guess is that each firm is actually making various level of losses and since firms are price takers, this must mean that they have different cost structures so that the firms exiting are the ones that are making the largest losses first.\r\n\r\n But under perfect competition, we also assume perfect information. Doesn't this imply that firms will have access to the same technology and hence, the same cost curve?\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nBased on the comment of Adam Bailey, in the short run, firms can shutdown instead of exit the industry when they are making losses, where making losses mean their selling price is below the their average variable costs.\r\n\r\nBut if their selling price is below their minimum average costs, then in the long run, they will exit the industry.\r\n\r\nSince perfect information for producers imply that they only have access to the same production technology and not the actual resources to acquire it, it is conceivable that although each producer is producing an identical product, each have very different cost structures.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only reason I can think of why producers won't exit the industry en masse is because each is hoping that the more expensive producer will exit first.\r\n\r\nIs this the logical conclusion implied by the perfect competition model?"}

It is free in both PDF and .epub formats. It derives the supply curve very slowly from first principles. \r\n\r\nThe first thing you need to realize is that that a supply curve is not a curve at all, it is a bunch of points. We only draw it as a line for convenience. Download the PDF and take a look at the three diagrams on pages 88, 120, and 121, and this will be clear. In order to understand supply curves, you need to understand value scales. Most textbooks skip this step, that is why it is a bit fuzzy.\r\n\r\nGiven a quantity X, suppose price P is the maximum the market will pay for each unit of the product such that the quantity X will be sold. Then the point (X, P) forms a point on the supply curve.\r\n\r\nFor example, lets say the market will pay at most \\$10 per hat for 100 hats. Then (100, 10) will be a point on the supply curve.\r\nSuppose the market will pay at most \\$7 per hat for 200 hats. Then the point (200, 7) will be on the supply curve as well.\r\n\r\nThis is a quote from page 121 of the book.\r\n\r\n> The tabulation of supply offered at any given price is known as the\r\n> supply schedule, while its graphical presentation, with the points\r\n> connected here for the sake of clarity, is known as the supply curve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://mises.org/rothbard/mes.asp"}

It is one way to define economic growth (if you hold everything else constant). Economic growth is when the economy can produce more output with the same input (due to an increase in capital goods).\r\n\r\nIf you can buy the same TV for half the price because the manufacturer is more efficient.

And in some areas, investors do step in. But in other areas, urban decline goes unarrested, possibly for decades, and we end up with ghost towns.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of the commons\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnd now to ubiquitous negative externalities. An article of mine published in INFO magazine explored these, in a section on [the Tragedy of the Commons][1]:\r\n\r\n> The economic imperatives that lead to the spiralling of negative externalities into an environmental crisis is well-documented: back in 1968, the inevitable tragedy of the commons was first written of in scientific journals: that a resource used by all but owned by none, would inevitably be over-used until it turned to dust.\r\n\r\nThat paper was \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" by Garrett Hardin, published in Science, 162(1968):1243-1248. However, Aristotle had written about the same phenomenon two millennia previously.\r\n\r\nReturning to my article:\r\n \r\n > The inevitability of the tragedy of the commons became economic orthodoxy. However, more\r\nrecently, Elinor Ostrom has documented several cases showing that the tragedy of the commons was not inevitable.\r\n\r\nJoint stewardship to protect the commons\r\n----\r\n\r\nOstrom went on, in her Nobel-winning research, to document the circumstances in the commons were protected, and negative externalities curbed. From the same article as above:\r\n\r\n > In many cases, communities had formed joint-stewardship agreements to\r\nsustainably manage common resources, such as fishing grounds, groundwater supplies, and grazing commons. They used frequent mutual monitoring and discussions between themselves to ensure that agreements were kept, and offenders were sanctioned with penalties determined and agreed in advance by all.\r\n\r\nAnd here is as far as we can get in answering the question: \r\n\r\n > how \"bad\" (as quantitatively as is possible for such a normative judgement) does it get before the market responds?\r\n\r\nFrom experience, some times the market simply does not respond, until the marginal damage cost gets so high as to equal a market participant's mitigation costs: that is, the point at which the commons have deteriorated so far that it's profitable for individuals to intervene.  Joint-stewardship agreements can prevent things getting that bad, but only if specific structures and circumstances are in place to enable those agreements to form. In many cases they are not there, and hence the destruction of the commons documented by Hardin, Aristotle and others. In other words, sometimes market failure is terminal.\r\n\r\nThese joint-stewardship agreements have also been done at the global level - for example the [Montreal Protocol][2] protecting the ozone layer. Such agreements can combine regulation and market mechanisms: for example, proscribing certain goods or acts, and enforcing a quota on others; together with Pigouvian taxes to price in the negative externalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://energynumbers.info/wp-content/uploads/Why-the-green-economy.pdf\r\n  [2]: http://www.multilateralfund.org/"}

But as he is the first one to travel between them (and I extend that mean there's been no trade so far either), no-one in his country has any of the other country's money.\r\n\r\nSo he needs to find someone in the other country to do the exchange with. That person won't do the trade unless they can do something useful with the money - either because they will be travelling to the first country soon, or because they can find someone else to trade with who will be. In practice, this restricted availability of people to do the exchange with is likely to mean getting a very poor exchange rate.\r\n\r\nI would instead advise the guy to travel with some durable and portable goods or commodities that have value in the other country. He can then indirectly convert his money by buying the trade goods in his own country and selling them in the other country. The exchange rate for going via any particular goods can be calculated by reference to the relative prices of those goods in each country, perhaps after taking into account any costs of transport."}

So fearing that someone will steal your money or it will be taxed away you buy a one-year (zero-coupon) government bond at zero nominal interest, so it'll give you 100 dollars back in one year. However, in that year the economy struggled: there was no productivity growth and the FED, in this extreme example, eventually doubled the money supply through its quantitative easing. So at the end of the year you are paid $100 by the government, but you can now only buy 50 cheeseburgers or a single nice shirt. The real effective rate of interest was therefore -50%.\r\n\r\nNumbers can of course be adjusted for a more realistic example. I.e. investing the money at 2% nominal interest would have been better than just holding on to the cash even if the return on both \"investments\" is negative in real terms."}

This is particularly problematic if the government has large levels of debt and are dependent on debt funding. Loosing the confidence of the stability of the currency will undermine faith in the stability of government bonds. As the real return of the government bonds becomes more uncertain these become less desirable. In essence the government paying for the bail-outs may be less costly for the government (and investment in the country in general) than a central bank bail-out.\r\n\r\nThat said, the Fed's QE programs are basically transferring the bail-out from the government to the central bank, so the threat is more real in Europe, where government debt is already in question, than in the US (other euro complications aside)."}

If the value of money is growing, people will tend to hold on to it thus reducing the amount available for \"normal\" circulation and reducing the number of transactions which can be undertaken. This would reduce growth if the amount of transactions taken is lower than the amount which would satisfy supply and demand. Access to credit can alleviate this as people can buy on money they don't have on hand.\r\n\r\nEventually in a credit system, access to credit becomes the constraint and so reductions in access to credit, due to various market shocks, even if temporary, can constrain the amount of money available for the \"normal\" flow of money and reduce the number of transactions despite otherwise steady supply and demand.\r\n\r\nJapan has had deflation and varying growth for the last decade.

The question has to do with how experiments are measured/designed to come to conclusions about correlation between two variables. Hopefully, it is relevant to economics. Otherwise, kindly guide me to the appropriate forum.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this article: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-new-brain/201204/religion-and-reason\r\n\r\nMy question is, when the experimental group turned out to be composed of more disbelievers than the control group (that's what I suppose the statement \"**more likely to be disbelievers**\" means), the scientists are attributing it to the analytic test.\r\n\r\nSo they are effectively saying that their analytic test caused more than average disbelievers i.e. it managed to \"convert\" some people from a supposedly random and homogeneous enough group into disbelievers, right? That's what they are saying - some people who before the analytic test thought they were believers after the test changed their stance.\r\n\r\nAm I wrong in this understanding? Thanks in advance."}

The key article in this area is by [Morduch (1999)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2565486).\r\n\r\nThe group lending incentive is the most studied mechanism for improving repayment in environments in which collateral cannot be collected (and in which proper credit markets are absent).  Quoting Morduch (p. 1570):\r\n\r\n> Group-lending contracts effectively make a borrower's neighbors\r\n> co-signers to loans, mitigating  problems  created  by  informational\r\n> asymmetries  between  lender  and  borrower.  Neighbors  now  have\r\n> incentives to monitor each other and to exclude risky borrowers from\r\n> participation,  promoting repayments even in the absence of collateral\r\n> requirements.\r\n\r\nOne implementation is to lend to \"two members of the five-person group... [i]f they repay on time, the next two get loans, and finally the fifth gets a loan. The process continues in turn as long as performance is satisfactory, but in principle when a member defaults, all five are barred from borrowing in the future.\" [Aghion and Morduch (2000, p. 3)](http://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/D1_FAI_BeyondGroupLending_0_0.pdf).  Thus, each member of the group has incentive to encourage other members to repay.\r\n\r\nThe group lending mechanism has been extensively studied.  A key article on how the peer lending mechanism works is by [Ghatak (1999)](http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/mghatak/jde1.pdf).  In micro-finance environments, there is often a problem of information asymmetry: the lender can't simply pull a credit report.  Group lending causes borrowers to select team members according to local information on their ability to repay.  That is, low risk borrowers will choose a team that is also low-risk (and exclude high-risk borrowers).  At the risk of oversimplifying, the idea is that a high-risk group member, knowing that his collaborators are less likely to repay, will be unwilling to accept relatively large loans.  Thus, groups self-select appropriate loan packages.\r\n\r\nIn environments where collateral is available (e.g. in transitioning economies), more traditional contractual methods are employed.  That is, borrowers put up assets to secure the loan.  In other areas, a committee is established to guarantee loans at the village level, and to provide a character reference for the potential borrower.\r\n\r\nA final feature of many of these loans is an often weekly repayment schedule, beginning immediately after loan initiation.  It was once explained to me that this is helpful for people who aren't used to formal financial arrangements--to get them into the habit of repaying immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Let me give you the basic intuition behind two main theories of why group lending works.\r\n\r\nThe first explanation, which is an **adverse selection** story attributable to Ghatak (1999) and Van Tassel (1999), suggests that group lending works because borrowers have more information about each other than the lender does. When the lender asks borrowers to form groups, they sort themselves into groups of \"good\" borrowers and \"bad\" borrowers (roughly speaking, \"good\" borrowers want to form groups with other borrowers like themselves, leaving the \"bad\" borrowers to form groups on their own). As a result, within one or two loan cycles the wheat is separated from the chaff and repayment rates soar, simply because only the best credit risks remain in the borrower pool.\r\n\r\nThe second explanation, which is a more common **moral hazard** story, argues that monitoring borrowers is hard, both during the project and afterwards, when the bank needs to figure out whether the project was successful. When there is group liability, borrowers monitor each other, ensuring that repayment rates are high. The important insight here is that microcredit institutions are tapping into the so-called **social capital** of the borrowers: even though the banks cannot punish the borrowers who don't have any collateral, other group members impose **social sanctions** to ensure repayment.
