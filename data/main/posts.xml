Under perfect competition, the demand curve represents demand for perfectly substitutable products from many firms.  For example, many agricultural products are perfect substitutes (I don't care if my corn came from farm A or farm B).  In markets for undifferentiated products, there little incentive for firms to engage in marketing activities because other firms will capture much of the benefit (this is why we don't see ads for, say, wheat).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, some firms endeavor to create a separate market for their product, usually by branding.  Advertising and other marketing activities can be used to create this separate market and to influence demand in that market.

Apple succeeded in differentiating their MP3 player, the iPod, sufficiently to create a separate market.  In this market, Apple could capture the benefits of advertising, and they could also exercise some monopoly powers (as they were the only source of iPods).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, firms will only endeavor to influence demand if they can differentiate their product from others, so the real questions firms ask often relate to how they might convince consumers that their product is really different from products of other firms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastActivityDate="2011-10-11T20:31:22.390" CommentCount="0" />

Think about the market for PCs, for example. PCs have simultaneously fallen in prices consistently for over 20 years, at the same time getting more powerful and useful. Computer companies are making good money and consumers are getting great products. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The danger of falling prices has to do with &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; prices are falling. If, as in the case of the PC, prices have fallen slowly over time due to increases in capital concentration and worker productivity, then falling prices are a good thing! We can buy more and better goods with the same amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, prices fall because the economy is growing but the supply of money is fixed, then this &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; pose problems. There are a few problems commonly called out by critics of deflation, so I'll try to name a few and then offer my opinion:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. Deflation encourages savings, not borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This criticism is that the deflation rewards savings and makes borrowing money more costly, so it will shift the balance between savings and lending, perhaps to the detriment of society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with this. Savings and borrowing must occur in equal amounts. I cannot borrow money unless I can find somebody else who has savings to lend to me. The interest rate is the &quot;price&quot; associated with saving and borrowing money, and this price should naturally float to a place where the supply of savings is roughly equal to the demand for borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B. Price deflation leads to wage deflation/higher unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The criticism here is that lower prices mean lower corporate profits, therefore companies will cut wages or fire workers to stay profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I disagree because the increase in capital investment and worker productivity each year acts against wage deflation. In other words, prices may be lower, but each worker is also more productive. This effect of productivity may completely offset the decrease in prices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the effect of increasing productivity is not large enough to offset the decrease in prices, then we still don't have to accept high unemployment. Instead, we might accept that wages may decrease slowly in times of low economic growth. In the US, we expect salaries to inch higher every year, but this expectation is largely based on 100 years of central banking that promotes low-and-slow inflation. I believe that this is a mindset that could be changed slowly if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C. Price deflation encourages buyers to defer purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The criticism here is that if consumers believe deflation is a trend, then they expect that the value of a car (for example) will be less next year than it is this year, and therefore they will wait to purchase a new car.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again I disagree. People will buy things they need no matter what, such as food, clothing and shelter. Furthermore, there is always a premium to having something now versus in the future, so even if you think a car may be a little cheaper several years from now, you're willing to pay a bit more to have it right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look at the PC example. Prices have dropped steadily for over 2 decades. This is a fact known widely among all PC consumers, and yet consumers continue to buy new computers, knowing full well that next years computers will be a little cheaper and a little more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2011-10-12T02:21:25.440" CommentCount="1" />

So most typical cases of unemployment you can think of come under involuntary unemployment (the other common type is frictional unemployment, i.e., unemployment attributable to being 'between jobs').&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why is there such a huge debate about this? Believe it or not, until recently most prevailing models, being neo-classical in origin, assumed that unemployment is always voluntary. That is, if someone is not working it's because they do no want to work at the prevailing wage rate. The 2010 winners of the Nobel Prize, Diamond, Mortensen and Pissarides, are commonly credited with fixing these problems by making better employment search models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the quotation above, Keynes is probably saying that involuntary unemployment arises because the market takes time to adjust. suppose wage is w and the real wage is w/p. At this wage, some agents are willing to work but can't find work. Now if p rises, real wage falls, therefore demand for labour rises. This is why you get both surplus demand and supply of labour.

Let me dive straight into the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The work of Kahneman and Tversky (two psychologists) was awarded the Nobel in Economics for the way they broke down the rational man paradigm. Since then, three alternatives have emerged:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) What I call soft behavioural economics (e.g., Matthew Rabin's work). The premise here is that people are irrational and are motivated by things like jealousy, anger, etc. No holds barred irrationalities are allowed (as long as the model is still solvable!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) Hard behavioural economics (e.g., Gul and Pesendorfer). People have a behavioural quirk (e.g., tendency to procrastinate), but except for that they still behave in a fully rational manner. In slightly more technical terms, the content of one's preferences have changed, but the procedure to find the optimal choice is still fully rational. Under the same category is Procedural Rationality (e.g., Rubinstein's work). People adopt a procedure which is not fully rational, but follow it consistently and logically. For example, while choosing from a menu, you might not pay attention to some options on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) Prospect Theory. Developed by Kahneman and Tversky themselves, this is a descriptive model. They incorporated elements from their experiments to come up with a 'utility function' (actually, its shape). Its main characteristics are &quot;loss aversion&quot; and the &quot;zero effect&quot; which I won't go into here. Prospect Theory is popular among experimentalists, but the problem is that it has no microfoundations at all. As a result it is unclear how it should be modified to fit settings outside the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a fourth response mentioned below: bounded rationality. That is, to me, the most appealing. Unfortunately, it's also currently the least fashionable among microeconomic theorists.

I'll do this in 2 steps. First I'll show some data to establish plausibility for this theory. Second, I will explain the reasoning behind my theory to [hopefully] establish causality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most notorious financial products in recent history is the mortgage-backed security (MBS). This financial product allows investors all around the world to easily and relatively safely tap into the US mortgage market.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How popular were MBS?

Notice that this data is in constant dollars. In other words, when the black line goes up, that means housing prices are going up faster than the cost of the average consumer good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LrQT3.png&quot; alt=&quot;case_schiller_history&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look what happens right around 2000... a huge spike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now as I said above, there are plenty of ways to rationalize away this spike. Cheap US monetary policy, new mortgage products, etc. So although the data &lt;em&gt;plausibly&lt;/em&gt; supports my assertion, let me switch to reasoning about why the higher degree of financialization might increase home prices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most home shoppers begin by calculating what they believe they can afford. Usually they start with annual salary and work backwards to some monthly payment that they can handle. Then they start looking for loan products that match their monthly payment. These loan products can finance different amounts of principal depending on their terms. For example, a 15 year mortgage at 5% will finance much less than a 30 year mortgage at 5%. There are other mortgage products that might help you finance even more (get leveraged higher) such as low-LTV loans, ARM loans, reverse-am loans, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let's say two people, Adam and Bob, both want to buy the same house. Both make the same amount of money, but Bob's bank offers exotic and more highly leveraged loan products than Adam's bank. Adam places his bid on the house based on his monthly payment and the amount his bank will let him finance. If Bob had the same financing as Adam, then the story would be over. Bob would not be able to bid any higher since he and Adam have the same leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But since Bob actually has higher leverage, he can easily outbid Adam for the house and Adam has no recourse -- Adam is already fully leveraged and cannot bid any higher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a highly contrived example, but you can see how financialization can lead to increased leverage, and this in turn enables greater buying power, and greater buying power can bid up the prices. If the buying power of all people generally grows over time (i.e. highly leveraged mortgage products are made available to more people), then we'd expect that to raise prices dramatically since now all bidders would be equipped with greater buying power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2011-10-12T05:37:47.927" CommentCount="5" />

That is why GDP, being a simpler measure, can be used most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, looking at wealth rather than GDP is much more important when one's studying inequality rather than growth, since GDP is conceptually the wrong measure to use there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="68" LastEditorUserId="68" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-10-12T22:23:04.050" LastActivityDate="2011-10-12T22:23:04.050" />

You can figure out your own demand curve by doing the following exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say somebody opens a pizza shop in your neighborhood, and they auction off a bunch of pizzas every night. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are hungry and you're craving pizza, so you would gladly pay $10 for one pizza. You're not hungry enough to eat 2 pizzas yourself, so you wouldn't pay another $10 to get a second pizza. But if the second pizza was only $8 more, then you would go ahead and get one for your roommates to make up for playing loud music the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you think about how much each additional pizza is worth to you, you realize that each additional pizza has less and less appeal. There's only so much you can eat yourself, share with roommates, or refrigerate to eat later. So your willingness to pay more to buy more diminishes as the number of pizzas goes up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before going to the auction, you write down your preferences on a sheet of paper and bring it with you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Number Of Pizzas    Willing To Pay&#xA;1st                 $10 &#xA;2nd                 $8  &#xA;3rd                 $6  &#xA;4th                 $2 &#xA;5th                 $1&#xA;6th                 $0.50    &#xA;7th                 $0.50       &#xA;8th                 $0.50      &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you can go to the auction and know exactly what your maximum bid is for each pizza. I.e. you'll bid up to $10 on a pizza until you win your first pizza. Then you will bid up to $8 until you win a second pizza. And so on…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What if the pizza restaurant does not auction off pizzas, but instead sets a fixed price for pizzas? Now how would you decide how many pizzas to buy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can figure this out quickly by looking at your notes for the auction. If the price of pizza is $7, then you will definitely buy at least 1 pizza (because the first pizza is worth $10 to you) and you will definitely want a 2nd pizza (because the second pizza is worth $8 at the auction) but you will not buy a 3rd (because the third pizza is only worth $6 to you).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The table above is called a &lt;em&gt;demand schedule&lt;/em&gt;. If we were to depict those series visually, we would call it a &lt;em&gt;demand curve&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/T85hj.png&quot; alt=&quot;demand curve example&quot;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aggregate demand curve for multiple people is easy to find &lt;em&gt;if you know the demand curves for each individual&lt;/em&gt;. You add up the quantity demanded for each person at each price. I don't know how to write the fancy equations, so here goes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;D(p) = sum(di(p))&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where D is the aggregate demand function, di is the i'th consumer's demand function, and p is price.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what shapes the demand curve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with this definition of demand is that it doesn't incorporate time as a variable or substitution effects -- other goods that similar but not identical to the good in question. This is why you never see a business owner in the real world whipping up a demand schedule and then charting the results. Most prices are either set &quot;by feel&quot; and experimented with, or companies may try to get a rough idea of demand by surveying consumers or conducting focus groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is it purely tastes and preferences, or are there other factors a company may be able to control or influence?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, in this simple model, it's just each individual's preference.

So it seems we are dealing with some sort of electronic currency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The issue of scarcity in traditional currency is handled either through trust that a government won't print excessive amounts of money or through natural means (e.g. there exists a finite amount of gold in the world).  A futuristic, electronic currency would either have to rely on a trusted 3rd party, a government, or &quot;built-in&quot; means to ensure scarcity.  One example of built-in scarcity would be crypto-currencies that rely on certain mathematical properties of cryptography to ensure scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now durability should be no problem for any sensible electronic currency; data can be backed up to one's heart's content.

In this paper, they do allow for abstention. Their proposition 1 states that abstention is strictly preferred by uninformed voters (when they are indifferent between the candidates and when no agent uses a strictly dominated strategy). The intuition they provide for this result is contained in the following. We assume that &quot;all informed independents vote for the correct candidate in each state&quot; and &quot;the correct candidate for the UIA [uninformed independent agents] is the candidate favored by the informed independent voters.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[T]he uninformed voter strictly prefers to abstain because the only&#xA;  way her vote effects the outcome is if she votes for the candidate not&#xA;  supported by the informed voter, i.e., the wrong candidate.

Instead of solving the model with something like Uhlig's (1997) log-linearization or Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe's (2004) approximation of the policy function (or any of the options I get with Dynare), I'd like to write up the agents in the model as objects in code, and step that code forward through time. There are three main obstacles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Agents need to have expectations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Markets need to clear.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The no-ponzi condition needs to be enforced.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) is simple enough. With one agent and one firm (or N identical agents/firms), the HH can form expectations over the true probability distribution of the future. The entire point of constructing this, however, is to allow for this expectations mechanism to be &quot;swapped out&quot; with others -- recursive OLS, for example, or Bayesian learning, or even some sort of &quot;meta-model selection&quot; as in LeBaron et al. (1999). Regardless, I have not problems here (yet).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) is where I currently have an issue. The tricky thing is that the basic RBC model has three markets -- consumption, labor, capital. The price of consumption is fixed in the original, which I retained, so that market is fine. For the other two markets, my first pass was to essentially create an auctioneer and have it do the tatonnement process. Come up with a price, hand it to agents, gather supply and demand, adjust the prices &quot;in the right direction,&quot; and hand them back. This is repeated in a single period until markets clear (supply and demand in all markets are within some epsilon). My first-pass attempt at this was to have a blindingly simple adjustment rule:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;p' = rho*(XD/XS)*p&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where p' is the next-period price for the market under consideration, p is price this period, XD and XS are excess demand and excess supply, respectively, and rho is a simple &quot;control&quot; to allow adjustment of the process. This is similar to price adjustment in LeBaron et al. (1999), but here is multiplicative, and my goal here is market clearing each period. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I quickly ran into some trouble -- my little RBC economy would run to zero in one or other of the markets fairly quickly. This, of course, may be due to a number of things -- I strongly suspect that my expectations process (initially, simple adaptive expectations) and/or the fact that I don't have a no-ponzi condition implemented (...yeah...) are the major things affecting my results. (I suspect I may be &quot;stepping off the convergent path,&quot; as it were. Perhaps not technically correct in a discrete-time model...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those, however, are questions for another post. Right now, I'm simply trying to think a little better about the market-clearing process. Does anyone have any suggestions?  I've recently stumbled across the WALRAS algorithm (Cheng and Wellman 1998), but am largely unfamiliar with computational tatonnement-style market clearing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ah, and I should note -- the purpose of all this is a few reasons -- one is just reproducing classic results (if possible) in a new way, another is giving myself a framework in which I can easily switch out expectational mechanisms and (eventually) incorporate various forms of agent heterogeneity in a general-equilibrium setting.

Private-sector players will have to make a differential diagnostic: they will have to analyse where policy trajectories would fork, for the different solutions, and watch policy announcements for those forks, and only then, invest accordingly (or, depending on the distribution of potential gains and losses, they might invest partially in all possible optimal outcomes, until a policy decision makes at least one outcome non-optimal).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the decarbonisation of electricity: it might be the case that in a current electricity market, neither PV, nor biomass, nor offshore wind, can compete with incumbents; but that with research funding and market reform, any one of them could be cheaper than either of the other two, and cheaper than the incumbents.  Let's say that the uncertainties around future costs, after economies of scale, mean that there is no significant difference in costs between a PV-dominant grid, a biomass-dominant grid, or an offshore-wind dominant grid; but that any of these is cheaper than a grid with no single dominant technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the policy-maker in this scenario, there is nothing to choose between supporting PV, supporting biomass, or supporting offshore wind, all other things being equal.

The metric is constructed so that it is equal to one if there is complete inequality (one person has/makes all the money), and zero if there is perfect equality (we all have/make the same amount of money).  Here we find that the gini coefficient on household income rose from 0.397 to 0.469 between 1969 and 2010.  Other metrics show a similar trend.  The mean log deviation of income (AKA Theil's L) has also been increasing.

Many potential &quot;human capital&quot; investments can be both investments and consumption.  Further, human capital investments can include non-educational expenses, most notably health-related expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that caveat in mind, let's consider the return to education while clearly acknowledging that we are assuming away other human capital investments that might be complements and/or substitutes.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We tend to talk about under-investment in relative terms.  For example, whether we are sub-optimally investing in education depends on its return relative to that of physical capital.  So, we can simplify the question into something more easily answerable and ask: what is the return to education relative to the return to capital?  For example, from one of the more widely cited (but now a bit dated) papers on the subject by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sites.google.com/site/mavalfortwebpage/home/teaching/development-economics-psme-1/Psacharopoulos_1994.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Psachropoulous (1994)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The lowest  social  rate  of  return  average  referring  to  higher&#xA;  education  in  OECD  countries  (8.7%)  is  close  to  the (long-term)&#xA;  opportunity  cost  of  capital.  This  means  that  the  profitability&#xA;  of  human  and  physical  capital,  at the  margin,  has  reached &#xA;  virtual  equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The author found much higher rates of social return to education in Sub-Saharan Africa (~24% primary, 11.2% higher ed) and &lt;strong&gt;private rates of return&lt;/strong&gt; that were even higher.   This is a clear signal that education is probably underinvested relative to capital.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, as you point out, we are (implicitly) ignoring the fact that in some cases, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030438789390084Z&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ljungqvist (1993, p.220)&lt;/a&gt; put it &quot;future  labor  earnings  cannot  serve as  collateral  on  a  loan.&quot;  As is common in development economics, whenever we see (especially private) returns to an activity or factor that are not in-line with returns to other activities/factors, we begin to think about missing or incomplete markets.  Here, we find that developing country credit markets are, for many people, missing (absent physical capital) hence the differential returns to education between high- and low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastActivityDate="2011-10-17T23:47:02.843" />

As this happens, demand for food generally, and especially for meat increases.  Thus, more grain is fed to livestock, and quite a few calories are lost in the conversion from grain to meat.  Supplying 1kg of beef, for example, requires over 7kg of grain. A less important, but also significant factor is the diversion of grain/sugar to energy production (especially in the US and Brazil).  This tends to increase global agricultural prices, leaving the bottom billion in a bit of a lurch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, farming in almost all countries is becoming more land intensive (increased land:labor ratio).  Thus, this increasing amount of food is being produced by fewer people--the number of farmers per non-farmer is decreasing.  Since partial productivity in labor and land are also increasing, returns per farmer are also increasing, even in low-income countries.  (See fig 3.5 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.card.iastate.edu/books/shifting_patterns/pdfs/chapter3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alston, Beddow and Pardey (2010)&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Labor and land productivity (in $/worker and $/hectare) are both rising in agriculture in almost all countries, and have been since at least 1961.  There is no evidence of agricultural value added (per worker or per hectare) decreasing except during some isolated events (e.g. land and labor productivity decreased in the Former Soviet Union after the state collapsed, but have been recovering over the past 20 years).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that agricultural prices largely respond to global, not local (or national) markets (although there are significant price &quot;wedges&quot; in some markets).  Thus, local ability to pay does not drive as much of the farm-gate price as one might think.  However, prices can be depressed in local markets, but only insofar as transport and trade barriers drive a wedge between local and global prices.  So, while local ability to pay can affect local agricultural prices, the effect is rather limited in many markets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-10-18T13:18:42.900" LastActivityDate="2011-10-18T13:18:42.900" CommentCount="1" />

Namely, students using the former system seem to default at a much higher rate.  The article implies that this higher default rate is due to lower earnings (and less &quot;gainful employment&quot;) among for-profit alumni.  It appears that policies may change to make it harder for students at some for-profit schools to get student loans.

If students who attend the for-profit schools would not otherwise seek higher education, then there may be some social benefits lost from no longer supporting them.

Now, the individual ATC curves are short run average cost curves for different levels of output.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firms are more constrained in the short run, so therefore may be forced to produce a non-optimal output. For any given level of output, the lowest possible cost is that which is achievable in the long run. So, to produce $Q_1$ in the short run, the firm will find itself on $ATC_1$.  The lowest possible (minimum) average cost in the short run provides one point on the long run curve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given an infinity of output quantities, we can trace a continuous LAC curve by tracing these minimum points on the ATC curves (only three such points are shown in the chart).  So, LAC is showing the lowest cost for each level of output, not input ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To see why the LRMC curve intersects LAC at it's minimum, consider that $LAC = C(Q)/Q$ so that at its minimum we have (by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero): $$C&amp;#39;(Q)/Q=C(Q)/Q^2 \implies C&amp;#39;(Q)=C(Q)/Q ~ or ~ MC=AC$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leaves a final question:  why don't the individual SMC curves intersect the corresponding ATC curves at their minimums?

Because those who pay for public goods do not get the full benefit themselves, public goods are under-produced. Government is one way to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The classic example is street-lighting. Everyone benefits from being able to see at night, but each individual does not derive so much benefit that they would unilaterally spend a fortune to light the roads that they use most often.

Particularly on the topic of non-rival goods, the items are often not perfectly non-rival. In fact, the definition of a public good is more theoretical than real. For example, focusing on the idea of street lamps, each lamp can only offer so much light. There is a point at which it starts to exclude. Even something as seemingly non-rival as oxygen does have a real measurable limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is easily understandable when it comes to something such as an interstate. While traffic is low, the MC of one more driver is negligible, but traffic congestion has become a major issue. However, this imperfectness often leads to methods of properly allocating these goods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A large part of the importance in public goods comes from the research in efficiently supplying them. Without a method of offering them, we would all be worse off. However, if too much goes into supplying them, we can be worse off as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A note about the facebook discussion above. The fact that we tend to be a product for facebook to sell should/could probably be viewed as a mechanism of charging for a public good. We collectively benefit from its existence, but charging for such websites has long been difficult. They have just found a method of doing so. However, one can use this type of public good to see some of the issues with it. There are sites that exist solely based on donation and voluntary payed memberships. There are also sites that have switched to payed memberships only. Doing the latter has often led to failure (e.g. the NY Times paywall), but voluntary memberships allow for free riding. None of these websites tend to be perfectly public and there are relatively obvious methods of charging for them, but doing so tends to have such negative effects that they are unsustainable... which circles back to them acting as public goods. For goods seen as non-essential, those best able to monetize are best able to survive, which makes them seem to be less of a public good. However, one should be careful not to forget that if the methods of monetizing the good fails, they will once again act as a public good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel this fact that many public goods are not perfect public goods is quite significant. Partially, because what happens at these margins as public goods become rival can have significant negative effects. Also, because discussing only theoretical perfect public goods ignores all of the goods that typically function as public goods. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A final note on the importance of public goods via example. As stated, defense spending is often given as public. However, a major difficulty of public goods is deciding what amount of spending on a public good is optimal. For those who feel we are no safer with additional bombs an missiles, they see our current defense spending as wasteful and inefficient. However, others feel that we cannot possibly be safe enough and argue that defense spending must always be a priority since we all benefit so much from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="221" LastActivityDate="2011-10-29T19:29:02.680" />

Basically, you have an auction in which everyone stands up initially. Once the auction starts, you state the starting bid (say 10 cents) and anyone who wants to continue vying for the dollar continues to stand, everyone else sits. And you keep increasing the bid every few seconds until you are left with only one person standing. The catch is this: the winner pays his/her final bid, and the second place finisher pays his/her final bid as well. Often, individuals will go well over the value of a dollar to win a bid and the auctioneer tends to turn a profit. You can increase these profits by requiring all players pay their final amount (thus those who sit down immediately are the only ones who pay zero). This demonstrates a few concepts: first, that the best strategy is to not play (the NE of the game, in fact) and also that of sunk costs.

I'll try to justify this conclusion as I think it is an important point that is often lost in these discussions...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we are talking about partial labor productivity (PFP) then it is usual to find that labor productivity increases with capital intensity.  Indeed, one of the most important drivers of European labor productivity growth has been changes in the labor participation rate; for example European labor participation fell between 1973 and '95 (apparently as a result of tax policy), causing capital substitution and, hence, relatively rapid increases in labor productivity (GDP per hour worked).  The opposite happened after 1995--labor productivity growth slowed (&lt;em&gt;even though labor quality was increasing&lt;/em&gt;) due to labor market reforms aimed at increasing labor participation rates.  See van Ark et al. (2008, JEP 22(1)) for a good discussion along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another  way to consider the same issue is to look at multi-factor productivity.  EU MFP growth decreased from about 1% in '70-95 to about 0.5% in '95-06.  As a result, labor productivity growth fell even though average worker skill levels were increasing (see O'Mahony et al. in &lt;em&gt;Innovation and Economic Development&lt;/em&gt; (Cimoli et al eds)).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastActivityDate="2011-10-31T13:56:06.950" />

Those countries that have would be inclined to pull away from those that do not to keep from being pulled down with them.

If the market for tutors is perfectly competitive, then the typical argument will show that tutors will be paid the value their marginal product (VMP).  We could show that a more productive tutor will earn a higher wage, and therefore that setting an upper bound on tutor pay will distort the market.  In that sense, the question is similar to a previous question:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/299/what-are-some-general-economic-principles-that-guide-ceo-pay&quot;&gt;What are some general economic principles that guide CEO pay?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, a difficulty arises when we ask what, exactly, is the value marginal product of a tutor?  Let's assume that students hire a tutor in order to increase their grades.  Under this assumption, a better tutor--one that is more productive at increasing grades--will command a higher wage.  But, it is not at all clear how to convert the tutor's &quot;grade productivity&quot; into a VMP, and hence a wage.  That we don't really know how students optimize their study time, or how they go about valuing grades, is evidenced by the response to another question on this site:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/140/do-students-exhibit-rational-behavior-in-determining-study-time&quot;&gt;Do Students Exhibit Rational Behavior in Determining Study Time?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's assume that students can determine how much they are willing to pay for tutoring that will increase their grade by a certain amount (big assumption).  Then, if students understand how much the tutor can help them, they can form an accurate willingness to pay for tutoring.  Tutors, due to their experience, are likely to be able to fairly accurately predict just how much they will be able to help a student.  But the student might not.  If that is the case, then the tutor has more information than the student.  Perfect competition can break down under information asymmetry (see again &lt;a href=&quot;http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/299/what-are-some-general-economic-principles-that-guide-ceo-pay&quot;&gt;the question on CEO pay&lt;/a&gt;).  The wage cap might be an attempt to adjust for this asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perfect competition might break down in other ways too.  For example, suppose that for a given course there are only a few available tutors to serve many students.  In this case, the tutors can set a wage that is higher than their VMP (however that is assessed).  While the transaction is still voluntary (and hence mutually beneficial), the tutors would be using their market power to take more of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_surplus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;consumer surplus&lt;/a&gt; than they could under a competitive market.  The standard argument is that these high wages will induce more qualified people to become tutors, and that the increased supply would eventually decrease the wage.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, I assume that there are barriers to entry to becoming a tutor who is officially listed by the university.  Thus, it might be difficult for qualified people to become &quot;official&quot; tutors in response to the high wages.  If this is the case, one possible argument in favor of the cap is that the university wants to prevent providing an indirect subsidy to tutors just by listing them as an official tutor for a course. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the university may be reasoning that the tutors are using university resources (desks, chalkboards, meeting spaces, student registries) in furtherance of their business, and that the students have already paid for these resources.  They may view the wage ceiling as a market correction to internalize the cost of using university resources.  This is a very common argument among university administrators (e.g. in limiting vending prices), and, while I know nothing about the case at hand, seems to be the most likely case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the cap is desirable is outside the domain of economics--at best, we can state that it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; correct some market imperfections.  We'd have to know exactly what the university's policy objective is in order to assess the policy (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/416/why-cant-or-shouldnt-economists-answer-normative-questions&quot;&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t (or shouldn&amp;#39;t) economists answer normative questions?&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-07T07:27:13.370" LastActivityDate="2011-11-07T07:27:13.370" CommentCount="0" />

In order for this to difficult or impossible to stop by a central bank a political background which limits the possibilities of deflationary meassures might be necessary. Say the country has to pay reparations as Germany had to before the great depression. In such a situation the central bank might be &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; to print currency and make deflationary meassures impossible.

Governments borrow based on the assumption that the investment will be worth more than the future cost of borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In exchange for money today, investors ask for a return for taking on risk of default and the opportunity cost of not using that money elsewhere.  So it is a trade and both parties should benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the government fails to invest that money wisely then, certainly, the investor may come out of it better-off than the borrower (as long as the borrower doesn't default).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the reason that bonds are considered such a &quot;safe&quot; investment is that the lender / investor is also a taxpayer.  Government can nominally raise taxes on everyone to cover its debt to those self-same taxpayers.  Not only the wealthy and workers, but everyone is both borrower and lender (government borrows money from the people and then pays the people back with money it generates by taxing the people).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fly in the ointment is foreign investors who cannot be taxed directly.  Unfortunately, they can be taxed through trade tariffs.  As debt becomes unsupportable the drive to raise trade tariffs is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As should be clear: governments have the upper-hand in bond negotiations; they can raise taxes or tariffs, debase their currency, or simply default.

I think it is likely that for the larger part of this group, Government transfers are above their taxes paid on VAT. Insofar interest payments to the gain of bondholders most likely come from the upper half of the income distribution. Around 50% of income taxes and likely more than 50% of capital gains taxes come from the highest 10% of incomes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Defining this upper 10% as &quot;the rich&quot; and the 50%-90% incomes as middle class, we can stack this house of cards a bit higher, and look at two cases: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first case, only the rich hold bonds.

So I'll call it the White Swan Strategy, as a nod to Taleb. I'll update this intro if someone gives me the formal name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The White Swan Strategy aims to make long-term profits through accruing lots of small incremental wins. The challenge it faces is that the actions required to obtain the small wins usually involves paring away resilience; and that sooner or later, an event that was otherwise considered extremely unlikely or impossible (the Black Swan) comes along, and because of the reduced resilience, large one-off losses are made. Three things make the White Swan Strategy exciting:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's very difficult to estimate the cost of the Black Swan, in advance; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's very difficult to estimate the probability of the Black Swan, in advance; and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Humans are very bad at weighing up the significance of extremely small probabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that makes it a very big gamble as to whether or not the accumulation of lots of small incremental wins outweighs the rare large loss. The White Swan Strategy is a high-stakes game where no one is quite sure of the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just-in-time manufacturing is a White Swan Strategy: incremental cost savings are made through potential fast flexibility of choice of supplier, reduced costs of holding stock, and reduced losses from expired stock. All this comes at a risk of a sudden spike in costs: any delay in the supply chain, means that customers won't get their goods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Geographic agglomeration can also result in a White Swan Strategy: it enables lots of smaller producers to take advantage of some network effects and some economies of scale that would otherwise be unavailable to them. And those cost savings get passed on to their customers. However, if those customers choose to let the small cost savings outweigh the risks of lack of geographical diversity in their supply base, then they'll make lots of small cost savings over time, but if any geography-specific event happens (such as the Thai floods), then the lack of supply-chain resilience will turn into a sudden spike in costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Added to those White-Swan-Strategy effects, there's also a potential degradation of the Commons going on: anthropogenic releases of greenhouse gases cause changes in climate; but all our manufacturing (as well as habitation and farming) is predicated on the climate as it was throughout the twentieth century. Which means that climate changes can change formerly cost-optimal location decisions to become very sub-optimal.  Events such as the Thai floods will become more common, and although we cannot say for certain which extreme-weather event was or was not the result of human-caused climate change, we do know that the frequency of those will increase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As usual with these degradation of the Commons, we reach an aggregate state that is very sub-optimal, even though it was the result of the accumulation of individually-optimal decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="104" LastActivityDate="2011-11-15T13:49:52.430" />

The idea is that a decision maker is represented by a multitude of 'selves' your actions now determine what self you will become and this self then becomes a decision maker itself. Commonly, this is modeled now as a game between selves. For finite time horizon problems, an axiomatic characterization of the behavior in the multiple-self in terms of preferences over certain decision problems has been given by Gul und Pesendorfer (2005, REStud). The multiple-self model has certain pathological feautures related to the possible non-uniqueness of the equilibrium in the game between the selves, as documented in a note by Vielle and Weibull (Economic Theory, 2009).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A way of modeling changing tastes that is still somewhat popular in applied work goes back to Becker and Stigler (AER, 1977). They basicall treat the individual as having fixed preferences but changing the technology of enjoying consumer products. If you drink more wine, you become better at enjoying it. So their theory is really a theory of unchanging prefernces, designed to accomodate phenomena associated with changing preferences. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="397" LastActivityDate="2011-11-17T14:36:39.540" CommentCount="5" />

What you buy in this case is the &quot;peak&quot; power of the machine. For instance, you may need a petaflop machine (10^15 flops of peak performance) but only for a few hours, so you rent it.This is the case in some applications (nuclear physics for instance), while in others (insurance) you need less peak computation power but for a very long time.&#xA;In this second case, having a top notch supercomputer can be an attractor for companies that need it sometimes: the closest you are from the computer, the easiest it is to communicate quickly (if you have large amount of data).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;@DarkTemplar Exascale computing is the next step in the &quot;power scale&quot;, it is 10^18 (trillion in US english I guess) floating point opération per second (flops) while the best supercomputer is currently 7*10^15 (petaflop) (K computer, designed with Fujitsu equipments).&#xA;With an exascale computer, we will be able to model more complicated things (nuclear physics, cell behavior, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big Data is the buzzword picturing the fact that we have more and more data about everything : all phone calls, all mails, all behaviors (CC TV), all books, the web, etc. Since we have good data mining methods, it may be possible to process all the data for doing various stuff (from marketing to surveillance) if we have enough computing power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="82" LastEditorUserId="82" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-20T22:56:56.953" LastActivityDate="2011-11-20T22:56:56.953" CommentCount="4" />

In&#xA;  the same way, Prohibition in the United States in the 1920s led to a&#xA;  fall in beer consumption but a rise in the drinking of hard liquor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, if what you're doing is illegal anyway, may as well go for the jugular.  And, no matter how much governments spend on prohibition, the profits are better:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If a kilogram of cocaine retails for upwards of \$110,000, the exporter&#xA;  can easily afford to double the few hundred dollars paid to the grower&#xA;  without much damage to his overall margin. Attempts to persuade&#xA;  growers to switch to planting pineapples are equally doomed: the&#xA;  cocaine exporters can readily outbid any reasonable scheme.  ...  The&#xA;  costs of seizure are small compared with the profits. Earlier this&#xA;  year, the US Coastguard seized two vast shipments of cocaine, one of 8&#xA;  tonnes and the other of 13 tonnes. Together, they could have supplied&#xA;  21m retail sales. To the astonishment of law-enforcement officers, the&#xA;  retail price of cocaine did not appear to budge. The enormous street&#xA;  value of the product makes it extremely cheap to ship. As Mr Reuter&#xA;  puts it, “A pilot who demands \$500,000 for flying a plane with 250&#xA;  kilograms is generating costs of only \$2,000 per kilogram—less than 2%&#xA;  of the retail price. Even if a \$500,000 plane has to be abandoned&#xA;  after one flight, it adds only another \$2,000 to the kilogram price.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On taxing drugs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But there is another, more mundane cost that should be taken into&#xA;  account: the loss of potential revenue. One of the main reasons&#xA;  Prohibition eventually came to an end in America was that it yielded&#xA;  no tax revenues. Likewise, prohibition of drugs hands over to&#xA;  criminals and rogue states a vast amount of revenue—say \$80&#xA;  billion-100 billion a year, based on the gap between rich-world import&#xA;  prices and retail prices—that governments could otherwise tax away and&#xA;  spend for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="48" LastActivityDate="2011-11-19T21:06:04.837" />

Here is an excerpt from the talk:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just&#xA;  the poor who are affected by inequality. There seems to be some truth&#xA;  in John Donne's &quot;No man is an island.&quot; And in a number of studies,&#xA;  it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal&#xA;  countries at each level in the social hierarchy. This is just one&#xA;  example. It's infant mortality. Some Swedes very kindly classified a&#xA;  lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of&#xA;  general socioeconomic classification. And so it's anachronistically a&#xA;  classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their&#xA;  own. But then where it says &quot;low social class,&quot; that's unskilled&#xA;  manual occupations. It goes through towards the skilled manual&#xA;  occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high&#xA;  to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of&#xA;  larger companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across&#xA;  the social hierarchy. The biggest differences are at the bottom of&#xA;  society. But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to&#xA;  being in a more equal society. We show that on about five different&#xA;  sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United&#xA;  States and internationally. And that seems to be the general picture&#xA;  -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, that there might be a &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; effect on the upper-class' well-being from inequality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently I have to write a paper on exactly this question, i.e. does inequality have a negative effect on the (upper-class') well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question: what are good sources on this subject?

Below is an actual announcement issued by the treasury department that it will be having an auction to raise \$23 billion.&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bq1j7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The announcement indicates the date of the auction (March 8th, 2011 in the example) as well as deadlines for competitive (11:30 AM) and noncompetitive (11:00 AM) bids. If you would like to participate in the auction then your bids must be submitted before these times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive Bid&lt;/strong&gt; - the bidder specifies the maximum price they will pay for the security. All treasuries are priced in \$100 so bids are submitted in terms of buying a security that will repay the owner \$100 when the security matures (\$100 is the face or par value).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noncompetitive Bid&lt;/strong&gt; - the bidder does not specify any maximum price requirement. These bidders are first in line to be issued a bill but they will get whatever price is determined at auction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a limit of \$5 million that can be submitted as a noncompetitive bid per bidder per auction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For competitive bids any one customer can be awarded a maximum of 35% of the total offering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to better illustrate the mechanics of the auction let's go back to the example. The table below is a hypothetical list of bids for the \$23 billion being issued. The bids include the total amount the bidder is willing to purchase as well as the maximum price the bidder will pay based on a \$100 par value note.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bid 1: \$5 billion, max price: don't care (noncompete)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 2: \$10 billion, max price: don't care (noncompete)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 3: \$5 billion, max price: \$98&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 4: \$5 billion, max price: \$95&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 5: \$10 billion, max price: \$92&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 6: \$5 billion, max price: \$90&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notice there is a total of \$40 billion in bids. The auction is only for \$23 billion. This means some bids will go unfilled. The ratio between bids and the amount of the auction is called the bid-to-cover ration. For our example it is 1.74 (\$40/\$23). A high bid-to-cover ratio indicates a strong demand for the bonds since there are a lot of bidders. A low ratio indicates weak demand. A ratio under 2.0 is considered weak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bids are filled in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All the noncompetitive bids are filled first. This means Bid 1 and Bid 2 will be filled first. This fills \$15 of the \$23 billion leaving \$8 billion left. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once all the noncompetitive bids are filled then the competitive bids are filled next starting from the highest max price and proceeding to the lowest until the issue is completely fulfilled.  This means Bid 3 will be filled in full. The remaining \$3 billion will be issued to Bid 4. For this auction Bid 5 and Bid 6 will go unfilled.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Since Bid 4 was the last accepted competitive bid, its max price will be the price that &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; (both competitive and noncompetitive) bidders will receive. This price will also determine the yield for this auction which is 5.26% (100-95/95 * 100).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Results of our example auction:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bid 1: \$5 billion, max price: noncompetitive, &lt;strong&gt;All \$5 billion filled at \$95&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 2: \$10 billion, max price: noncompetitive, &lt;strong&gt;All \$10 billion filled at \$95&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 3: \$5 billion, max price: \$98, &lt;strong&gt;All \$5 billion filled at \$95&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 4: \$5 billion, max price: \$95, &lt;strong&gt;Only \$3 billion filled at \$95&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 5: \$10 billion, max price: \$92, &lt;strong&gt;Not filled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bid 6: \$5 billion, max price: \$90, &lt;strong&gt;Not filled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the auction is completed the treasury will post the results of the auction. Below is the actual results of the auction.&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zl4Lp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some additional items that are reported from the auction:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;High Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the highest yield (or the lowest price) that was accepted at the auction. For our example this would be \$95.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Allotted at High:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the percentage of the total that was filled at the highest accepted yield (or lowest accepted price). For our example, the last \$3 billion we filled was at the lowest price so our allotment at high would be \$3/\$23 = 13%.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Price as determined by the auction.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Median Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; Half of the competitive bids were submitted below this rate while the other half were above.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Low Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The lowest yield (or highest price) submitted for the competitive bids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The announcement also shows the breakdown of the amount of bids submitted noncompetitively versus competitively and how much was rewarded for those same categories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an entry in the middle of the results announcement listed as SOMA. This stands for System Open Market Account. This represents treasuries that are held by the Federal Reserve. If the Federal Reserve has treasuries that are maturing then it is expected that they will use the proceeds from those maturing treasuries to buy new treasuries. For our example auction the FED had no bills maturing at the time. If they did then the FED would also get the same price determined at the auction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="104" LastActivityDate="2011-11-23T12:17:44.787" CommentCount="1" />

Note that the methodology used to calculate the regional indices is separate from the nationwide index. The Case-Shiller National Index is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;a composite of single-family home price indices for the nine U.S. Census&#xA;  divisions and calculated quarterly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the regional indices, data is collected for transactions of all residential properties. The main variable used for index calculation is the price change between two arms-length sales of the same single-family home. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The regional indices are calculated monthly, using a three-month moving average algorithm, and published with a two-month lag. This helps offset delays due to &quot;clumping&quot; in the flow of sales price data from county deed recorders. It should also help assure sufficient sample sizes for robust average price changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;table*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; lists each of the twenty regional Case-Shiller real-estate indices, as well as the corresponding Bloomberg and Reuters ticker symbols:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5g64f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Case-Shiller regional real-estate indices&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full details of the components of the 20 regions, at a county and city level are available from the Index Methodology documentation.

He simply notes that military spending is one mechanism to achieve such research.

Prostitution, especially in developing countries, is accompanied by a lot of abuse, exploitation, trafficking and forced abduction. This process aims to coerce people into accepting a life of prostitution by systematically closing other options available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is precisely because coercive and downright immoral methods are used by traffickers to force young boys and girls into prostitution that prostitution should be legalised. Legalisation of the trade would allow authorities to better monitor the activity and enable the exploited to seek justice more easily.

This activity has two economically relevant features. &lt;strong&gt;(a)&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking is addictive, leading to &lt;strong&gt;time-inconsistent&lt;/strong&gt; behaviour, and &lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt; the health costs associated with smoking are borne by society as a whole, so it has &lt;strong&gt;negative externalities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem of addiction and time-inconsistency in &lt;strong&gt;(a)&lt;/strong&gt; is studied extensively in decision theory, notably by &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0262.00252/full&quot;&gt;Gul and Pesendorfer&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, their agent takes as given the fact that s/he is unable to stick to past plans (due to addiction or temptation) and then rationally responds to this problem by anticipating future time-inconsistency issues. Thus, it is possible that rational people have a strict preference for a smaller choice set in order to avoid being tempted. The key thing here is that the &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; of preferences has changed, but the way of making choices given that content is still &quot;rational&quot; in the sense of acting with foresight, unlimited computational and reasoning power, no mistakes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt; is not strictly relevant to your question, but I want to point out that even if limiting people's (legal) choices does not benefit them, it might still be the efficient thing to do from the point of view of society as a whole, because of a standard externalities argument.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="68" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-30T17:14:19.283" LastActivityDate="2011-11-30T17:14:19.283" CommentCount="4" />

Another way of saying this is that the purchasing power of a dollar-equivalent is far greater in developing countries than the US itself, thus allowing workers in other countries to work for less. For this reason an effective way of bringing back jobs to the US would be to prevent China from undervaluing its currency, which it has been doing for quite a while - How the US would manage to do that is another question :-). However note that even if there was no undervaluation of the Renminbi, there would still be a price level difference due to different standards of living.

One way to realize is this is that to consider that a manufacturer of a differentiated product faces a downward sloping demand curve just as a monopolist does. The issue with the monopolist is not so much that higher prices are charged (that would be a producer surplus offsetting the loss of the consumer surplus), but that the optimal social quantity of product is not produced (i.e. the sum of producer and consumer surplus is less than optimal).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Kirzner needs to formalize his argument in terms of another model.

In fact, the Fed is in a predicament because when the Fed attempts this unwind the impact on rates will have the opposite effects which will lead to drops in value of treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities and lead to a sharp increase in rates. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a nice explanation from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc101018.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Hussman&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;At present, heavy purchases of Treasury debt would be easily&#xA;  accomplished by the Federal Reserve. But once the Fed has quadrupled&#xA;  or quintupled the U.S. monetary base from its level of three years&#xA;  ago, how will it reverse its position? Japan was able to successfully&#xA;  reverse its program of QE several years ago without much impact on&#xA;  yields, but unlike the U.S., it had the luxury of an extremely high&#xA;  savings rate. With nearly 95% of its debt held domestically, Japan had&#xA;  no need to resort to foreign capital. In contrast, over half of the&#xA;  U.S. national debt is held by other countries. Without a deep pool of&#xA;  domestic savings, and with no repurchase agreements in place, the&#xA;  Federal Reserve will eventually have to entice domestic and foreign&#xA;  investors to buy the Treasury securities back, pressuring interest&#xA;  rates higher, and virtually ensuring a capital loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that QE will result in a significantly greater use of&#xA;  existing slack capacity and labor in the U.S. economy. But several&#xA;  years from now, as the U.S. economy recovers (no thanks to the Fed,&#xA;  but simply by the emergence of new technologies and markets through&#xA;  innovation), the Fed will have no easy choices. Attempting to sell&#xA;  massive amounts of debt into an expanding economy will risk pressuring&#xA;  interest rates higher and choking off the recovery, while paying&#xA;  interest on reserves to discourage banks from lending them will&#xA;  ultimately require the Fed to pay banks more than the yield on&#xA;  comparable Treasury securities, in order to cover the opportunity cost&#xA;  of keeping the reserves idle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="501" LastActivityDate="2011-12-03T17:56:49.040" />

Suppose that you do not really need a house but expect house prices to rise in a particular area for some reason (e.g., booming economy so people are getting richer and will want to buy houses of their own; the area is about to be connected by a metro/train, increasing its attractiveness as a residential property, etc.). A good idea (if you are sure the prices will rise) is to buy a house right now at a low price, wait for the prices to increase and then sell it for a net gain. Since you are speculating that the prices will rise, the resulting demand is called &lt;strong&gt;speculative demand&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is kind of speculation can be very lucrative. However, note that this means a lot of buyers are in the market simply to re-sell the house later on and will not really consume the good.

Roughly speaking, the reason for this is simply that the fundamentals of the market do not justify a sky-high price. As a result, after a few months (or years) of rising house prices, potential speculators realize that the price is not going to rise any further. But now no speculator wants to hold on to the good!

During the crisis banks were scrambling for cash to meet customer demands for cash.  Customers were liquidating their securities and money market accounts for cash.  Foreign banks wanted USDs because they are the most liquid and therefore can be used in almost any type of currency swap, repurchase agreement, or currency exchange giving the bank strength to obtain more foreign currency through any one of these arrangements as well as giving the bank the ability to provide its customers with USDs which were in high demand during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Why the foreign banks were desperate for US dollars is the reason of&#xA;  violations of covered interest parity?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Covered interest parity is a way to hedge against a &quot;carry trade&quot; transaction going against an investor.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, let's say the current exchange rate is 1 USD = 100 Yen and the current 1 year interest rate is 10% in US and 20% in Japan.  If I save 100 USDs, at the end of 1 year I'll have 110 USDs (100 USD * 1.10).  If instead, I exchanged my 100 USDs for 10,000 yen and saved in yen I would have 12,000 yen (10,000 * 1.20).  If the exchange rate is still 1 USD = 100 yen then when I exchange my 12,000 yen back to USDs I will have 120 USDs.  I effectively had a 20% return on my USDs.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what if the exchange rate changes during the year?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What if the exchange rate at the end of the year is 1 USD = 200 Yen.  When I exchange back to USDs I will now only have 60 USDs.  I would experience a loss of 40 USDs on my initial investment of 100 USDs.  To hedge against this I enter into a forward currency exchange contract for the end of the year at a predetermined exchange rate to hedge against changes in the exchange rate.  For the above case I would purchase a futures contract to exchange yen to USDs at a rate of 1 USD = 109.09 yen at the end of one year.  This way at the end of the year when I exchange my yen back to USD I will be guaranteed an exchange rate of 109.09 which yields me 12,000 / 109.09 = 110 which is what I would have made had I invested the USDs at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A violation of the hedge would be to enter into a futures contract for the currency where the investor, even with the contract as a hedge, could experience a loss with the current exchange rates and interest rates.  This was occurring because of the high demand for USDs.

Both are very prosperous countries, with some of the highest median standards of living in the world, and Denmark in particular repeatedly scores highest in the world on quality of life (taking into account direct economic measures as well as other measures). So it would be very hard to make a case that their regional development has been very detrimental to their economies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will depend on where a country is within its economic cycle. At the moment, in Europe, rates of return are extremely low. Which means that the discount rate applied to long-term investment is also very low. And that means that large, long-lived capital schemes that carry on delivering benefits for many decades, will show a much better Net Present Value. To take that bridge, for example, that cost NOK 230m (US\$40m at exchange rates of 2011-12-09); with a discount rate of 2%, then that amounts to just NOK4.6m (US\$0.8m) per year. Now, if most of the capital expenditure stayed within Norway anyway, and the bridge creates a few permanent jobs, then the business case will quickly stack up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regional development also plays a role in compensating for the economic inefficiencies that come about from having economically-disparate regions sharing a common currency - see &lt;a href=&quot;http://economics.stackexchange.com/q/18/104&quot;&gt;Does the financial system require different currencies to work properly?&lt;/a&gt; for related issues. Now, if they had different currencies, then exchange rates could vary to take account of different regions being at different parts of their economic cycle. Interest rates could also vary between regions. So there would be several additional adjustment mechanisms that would enable one region that was economically suffering, to have higher investment and cheaper exports to regions that were doing better.  When those regions share a currency, and there is no exchange rate to vary, and no opportunity for differential interest rates, then regional development can provide inter-regional adjustment mechanisms, and improve economic efficiency. Particularly if there are impediments to the movement of labour between regions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, high inter-regional variations in wealth can create a wide variety of social, criminal and health problems for all regions concerned; reducing wealth-differentials can reduce those problems, making everyone better off as a result (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/SearchResults?an=wilkinson&amp;amp;bt.x=0&amp;amp;bt.y=0&amp;amp;sts=t&amp;amp;tn=spirit%20level&quot;&gt;The Spirit Level&lt;/a&gt; for more on this).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say by any means that all regional development is desirable or economically successful: there are plenty of examples of failure too.

International&#xA;  trade in financial and legal services, insurance and consultancy is&#xA;  tricky to measure, and exporters are easier to identify than&#xA;  importers. For instance, law firms involved in cross-border deals are&#xA;  usually quite large, whereas most clients’ spending on their services&#xA;  is relatively small (though it may not seem that way to the clients).&#xA;  Exporters are thus more likely than importers to exceed the threshold&#xA;  for inclusion in the surveys used to track trade in services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data on GDP is derived from tax filings, and then cross-matched against import/export data.  Not all of this is accurately managed.  And that's before you get to politics.  Consider the following on Argentina:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A presidential election looms in October [2011] and inflation, and the&#xA;  government’s denial of it, is perhaps the biggest threat to the&#xA;  prospect of President Cristina Fernández winning a second term. That&#xA;  may be why Guillermo Moreno, the thuggish commerce secretary, is&#xA;  moving to stamp out the unofficial, but widely trusted, price indices.&#xA;  To do so he has dusted off a decree, penalising misleading&#xA;  advertising, approved by a military dictatorship in 1983. In February&#xA;  he sent letters to 12 economists and consultants ordering them to&#xA;  reveal their methodology, on the grounds that erroneous figures could&#xA;  mislead consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some of Mr Moreno’s targets refused; the rest were analysed by INDEC,&#xA;  which predictably found their methods flawed. Seven of them were then&#xA;  ordered to pay the maximum fine of $123,000 (all have appealed). The&#xA;  financial threat is especially serious for Graciela Bevacqua, who lost&#xA;  her job as head of INDEC in 2007 for refusing to tamper with the price&#xA;  index.

Suppose that for home, the unit labor requirements (denoted A) are: $A_X^H = 3$ and $A_Y^H$ = 6... that is, it takes 3 units of labor to produce a unit of good X and 6 units of labor to produce a unit of good Y.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose the other country (Foreign) has a different technology, such that $A_X^F=20$ and $A_Y^F=10$.  Here, Home can produce either good with less labor than foreign... it is said to have an absolute advantage in both goods.  Naive logic would lead us to the conclusion that there is no possibility of trade between Home and Foreign, since home is better at producing &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; goods. But we'll construct a simple example to show otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In these models, we usually have a fixed labor constraint (endowment).  We can allocate our labor to production of good X or good Y.  Notice that with the given unit labor requirements, in Home, producing an extra unit of good X requires that they give up ${1}/{2}\;$ units of good Y (that is, they must free-up labor by producing less of good Y).  In the foreign country, producing an extra unit of good X requires giving up 2 units of good Y.  This is the &lt;em&gt;opportunity cost&lt;/em&gt; of good X in terms of good Y (${1}/{2}\;$ for Home and 2 for Foreign).   So home has a lower opportunity cost of producing good X than does foreign.  Here, we say that home has a &lt;em&gt;comparative advantage&lt;/em&gt; in the production of good X and, by symmetry, that Foreign has a &lt;em&gt;comparative advantage&lt;/em&gt; in producing good Y (e.g. Home gives up 2 units of X for one unit of Y while Foreign gives up ${1}/{2}\;$ unit of X per unit of good Y).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This difference in &lt;em&gt;comparative&lt;/em&gt; advantage gives rise to potential gains from trade.  Consider that Foreign might produce a unit of good Y and trade it with Home for one unit of good X.  Home will accept this trade because they must usually give up 2 units of good X to get a unit of good Y.  Foreign also benefits since, without trade, they would need to give up 2 units of good Y to get a unit of good X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in this sort of logic, you would enjoy studying the Ricardian model in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-12-12T23:46:41.643" LastActivityDate="2011-12-12T23:46:41.643" />

This is certainly an advantage, because it means that there is less risk of getting stuck with an asset one does not want to own.

In order to hedge this risk, I want to buy aviation fuel futures, which might be what one would call an exotic asset. The problem is that there is not enough liquidity in this market, so I cannot buy any such futures at a decent price. Any trading of aviation fuel futures, including microsecond trading, would help increase its liquidity. However, since the liquidity of the airline fuel market is too low, I would be forced to buy oil futures instead. The oil price and the aviation fuel prices are likely to correlate, so this is quite suitable for hedging my risk. However, in the event of a sudden reduction in refinery capacity (for example because of a war), then my risk would maybe not be hedged, so the airline might get in trouble because of the sudden rise in aviation fuel prices. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would argue that any increase in the number of assets available (including exotic assets), would in general enable more efficient allocation of capital, as one can find the asset that exactly matches ones needs.

Also, it would expose the Federal Reserve balance sheet to a tremendous amount of short-term interest rate risk including losses on its holdings of longer-dates Treasuries and RMBS. Since the liability of the Fed is backed by the asset-side of the Fed balance sheet, the value of the currency would diminish. If interest rates increased the Treasury would also find itself paying higher rates and perhaps fail to roll-over the large quantities of debt required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also the ability of the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy would be undermined by a loss of credibility in the value of the currency and the policy messaging from the institution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="501" LastEditorUserId="104" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-12-17T06:17:52.997" LastActivityDate="2011-12-17T06:17:52.997" CommentCount="5" />

Since war is a means to end (or perhaps war is a means to establish supremacy during) a conflict, then yes, war is caused by conflicting self interest. I believe that psychologists over the answer to this question, and I am not qualified enough to answer it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if wars are bad for the general population because it&#xA;  kills them and destroys property, is it in the self interest of the&#xA;  leaders because they profit from it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two propositions here: a) War is bad for general populace. b) War is profitable for leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would argue that both are neither true nor false.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;War's affect on general populace (both negative and positive):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A fraction of the populace employed as a fighting force will die.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some fraction of the populace will die, if war takes place on/around their area of residence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;War will generate employment - as fighting forces.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;War infrastructure may generate employment - as weapons manuacturers etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Winning/losing a war will have an effect on national identity, thus changing the psychology of the populace.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Resources spent on the war may lead to lower standard of living&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Resources gained from war may lead to higher standard of living.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The outcome of the war may lead to political changes, which may widely affect the lives of the population on a very long term basis. (For example, the victory of England over India from 1757-1857 allowed for the colonisation of India, leading to a flow of wealth from India to England. This probably decreased Indian standard of living, while improving England's. )&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as leaders go, the popularity of leaders will change with the outcome/status of war. Winning a war will increase popularity (and possibly wealth in case of ogliarchies/monarchies etc.) , while losing one will lead to loss of popularity (and possible death, exile, loss of property etc.). So, war for leaders is like a high-risk high-profit activity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, note that while modern (political) leaders do not usually fight alongwith troops, in more ancient times, this was not always the case and leaders were expected to fight alongwith troops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thus, leaders exploit the population so that their utility increases? (i.e. money)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since a leader is not always facing an increase in utility, this is not true. But, it might be argued that a leader will not start/fight a war without having a belief in victory (of one sort or other), so a leader is trying to increase &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; utility. Since the war may also lead to benefits for the population, it cannot perhaps be said to be exploitation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, leaders refer to patriotism, nationalism and religion when they declare wars. Do these concepts give an illusion to the general population that their utility will increase (i.e. safety and better afterlife) in a vague intangible way?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These concepts affect the psyche of the population, and thus cannot said to be totally intangible. After all, happiness in life counts for &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, and if a person finds utility in religion, then a religious war may indeed increase his utility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Last, do leaders never look out for interest of the general population, and do they always look for themselves first? Therefore, do those in power always exploit those not in power when they feel like it, i.e. their interests are not aligned?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you believe the assumption of the book, that all humans are ultimately selfish, then yes.

Although&#xA;  the East India Company flourished a very long time ago, in a very&#xA;  different world, its growth, longevity and demise have lessons for&#xA;  those who run today’s state companies and debate their future, lessons&#xA;  about the benefits of linking a company’s interests to a nation’s and&#xA;  the dangers of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From The Economist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/node/21541753&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Company that ruled the waves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Company was certainly innovative:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Company’s success in preserving its animal spirits owed more to&#xA;  necessity than to cunning. In a world in which letters could take two&#xA;  years to travel to and fro and in which the minions knew infinitely&#xA;  more about what was going on than did their masters, efforts at&#xA;  micromanagement were largely futile. The Company improvised a version&#xA;  of what Tom Peters, a management guru, has dubbed “tight-loose&#xA;  management”. It forced its employees to post a large bond in case they&#xA;  went off the rails, and bombarded them with detailed instructions&#xA;  about things like the precise stiffness of packaging. But it also&#xA;  leavened control with freedom. Employees were allowed not only to&#xA;  choose how to fulfil their orders, but also to trade on their own&#xA;  account. This ensured that the Company was not one but two&#xA;  organisations: a hierarchy with its centre of gravity in London and a&#xA;  franchise of independent entrepreneurs with innumerable centres of&#xA;  gravity scattered across the east.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Company repaid the state not just in taxes and tariffs, but also&#xA;  in ideas. It was one of the 18th and 19th centuries’ great innovators&#xA;  in the art of governing—more innovative by some way than the British&#xA;  government, not to mention its continental rivals, and outgunned only&#xA;  by the former colonies of America. The Company pioneered the art of&#xA;  government by writing and government by record, to paraphrase Burke.&#xA;  Its dispatches to and from India for the 15 years after 1814 fill&#xA;  12,414 leather-bound volumes. It created Britain’s largest cadre of&#xA;  civil servants, a term it invented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The requirement for innovation was not as a result of their monopoly of the UK market, but their competition with other state-directed firms around the world.  Chinese oligopolies today compete with Russian, Brazilian, Korean and Indian state-protected champions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of this means that such champions are a good idea.  There are still dangers from such companies, not least because they become unelected government entities with unaccountable executives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How could it justify having a monopoly of trade as well as the right&#xA;  to tax the citizens of India?

Soon an interstellar trade is established at a certain exchange rate.  Alien corporations are established on both worlds.  What are some general strategies to minimize risk in these situations?

Then 10 years later, everyone worker made 200 widgets, earned the same 100 galactic credit (at much lower wage 0.5 credit per widget!), and widget pries fell proportionally to 0.75 credits per widget. Even though unit wages are now much lower, and total wages stayed stagnant, workers can now afford twice as many widgets as before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If workers now things are getting cheaper fast, they'll accept stagnant or even decreasing nominal wages - in theory they should care about their real purchasing power in terms of what they can buy with their wages, not with some numbers on bank statement. In practice it's somewhere in between - people mostly care about real purchasing power of their wages, but they care quite a bit more about numbers than rational expectations claim they should. (that's called &quot;money illusion&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to variety of problems like money illusion, zero bound, downward wage and price stickiness, debt deflation etc. deflation tends to quite harmful to economic activity, and even very low inflation (0%-4%) may not always be optimal.

But it doesn't mean they're not useful or real, as they are helping us to have a comprehensible model of a market.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About your second question: We're not talking about a single seller. We're talking about the market. Suppose that the demand reaches to a specific point (unchanged supply) which causes prices to rise. In this case the profit margin for producers (suppliers) increases and they will increase their supply to sell more and gain more profit. Now the supply is not fixed any more and more supply in the market causes the prices to come down.

But once they've psychologically broken that threshold, they may go higher still. c.f. the seemingly illogical pricing of some web &amp;amp; print publications, that offer, say, web-only subscription £50, print-only subscription £150, web &amp;amp; print subscription £150. Now, that seems illogical, right? Why would anyone go for a print-only subscription at £150 when they can get web &amp;amp; print for the same price? Well, for the publisher, this is a pricing trick, that converts &lt;strong&gt;web&lt;/strong&gt; sales into web &amp;amp; print sales, boosting their revenue: people spot the anomaly, and change their preference from a web-only subscription to a web &amp;amp; print one, because they feel that the &quot;illogical&quot; pricing gives them extra value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, that's just a couple of reasons why seemingly-illogical pricing structures can be a desirable thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are indeed discount structures that remove such anomalies.

By increasing the cost of goods and processes that emit GHGs, this reduces their equilibrium quantity - i.e. emissions go down. There are two types of substitution that might occur: there will be a combination of a switch to lower-carbon processes, and a reduction in the amount of carbon-intensive goods provided. For example, we might decarbonise paper production, or use less paper (or a combination of both those). OK, that's the basic microeconomics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) more efficient taxation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As discussed over in &lt;a href=&quot;http://economics.stackexchange.com/q/835/104&quot;&gt;Which kind of taxes has lowest deadweight loss?&lt;/a&gt; , because a Carbon Tax is a Pigouvian tax, it actually has a negative deadweight loss (assuming revenue exceeds cost of collection). Insofar as the revenue from a carbon tax allows other taxes to be reduced, the taxation system will be more efficient, if those other taxes have a deadweight loss. And that's the basic macroeconomics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) greater social welfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where things get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first-order effect: long-term equilibrium - this will show a greater total welfare, as an externality has been internalised: effectively, the subsidy of GHGs is reduced or removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, we currently have a very large industrial complex that has been built on highly-subsidised fossil fuels. This has led to large inefficiencies in how we lay out our patterns of land use, how we power our industries, light our offices, heat our homes. It's led to over-development of energy-intensive processes in industries, and under-investment in energy efficiency, and in lower-carbon technology. And it's led to market incumbents that have grown powerful enough to affect the policy of governments even in democracies. To move to a more energy-efficient lower-carbon equilibrium will require major shifts in industrial structure, urban structure, and changes in the allocation of political power. All of these shifts will have short-term transitional costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might be that low-carbon energy can become as cheap or cheaper than subsidised fossil fuels, in which case there won't necessarily be a transition to higher energy efficiency. Nevertheless, there will still be major shifts in the allocation of global political power, away from fossil-fuel extractors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it true that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;these goods and services with a carbon content (basically heating and transportation) have a very low price elasticity of demand (there are very few substitutes and they are essential goods anyway)&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, it's not true that there are very few substitutes, although it's perfectly understandable to see why at first glance there might seem to be. Short-term marginal price elasticity of demand is fairly low, but long-term elasticity could be much higher. We're about to find out. It might be worth comparing energy consumed per unit GDP of, say, Denmark and Germany, to see the long-term impacts of some energy prices being higher (Denmark has, for about 30 years, had high energy taxes for domestic use, though not for industry).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heating&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;transport&lt;/strong&gt; are, in almost all cases, both &lt;strong&gt;derived&lt;/strong&gt; demand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's take &lt;strong&gt;transport&lt;/strong&gt; first: I don't demand motorised travel directly: it's a demand that derives from the geographical separation of my home and my workplace. Because it's a derived demand, there are a lot of long-term substitutions: I could change my home and/or my trip destinations, to reduce my overall need for motorised travel. Or we could decarbonise the transport system, through some combination of biofuels, synfuels, zero-carbon electrification, and direct ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and sinking (sinking = long-term storage in a form that is mechanically and chemically stable).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now, let's look at &lt;strong&gt;heating&lt;/strong&gt;. I'll separate out space-heating from water-heating, but first I'll note that both can be decarbonised through some combination of solar-heating, biofuels, synfuels and zero-carbon electrification. Now let's look at space-heating. I don't demand space-heating directly: it's a demand that derives from my demand for a thermally-comfortable building. Now, that needs a lot of energy for space-heating because our buildings are insufficiently insulated and/or make insufficient use of solar gains. A well-insulated, well-designed building such as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.passiv.de/English/PassiveH.HTM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Passivhaus&lt;/a&gt; needs very little extra energy for space heating, even in Nordic climes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, both have plenty of zero-carbon substitutes, including reducing or eliminating the derived demand itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will it be enough?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can ask, will this be enough? The economic risks of failure to cut GHGs are potentially immense - the worst-case forecasts are of a loss of 90%+ of global GDP - but there are also high short-term political risks of setting a carbon tax high enough to be effective. The best-case forecasts are a loss of 2-5% of global GDP, relative to a contra-factual case of business as usual and GHGs being climate-neutral. With the cost of decarbonisation estimated at around 1% of GDP, the economics are overwhelmingly in favour of curbing GHG emissions. There have been very long discussions about the relative merits of quotas versus carbon pricing: as Marty Weitzman pointed out, to the first-order effect, they're equivalent. If quotas were sold by governments, rather than granted freely, then they too might show the triple dividend discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chris Hope and Nicholas Stern have tried to estimate the marginal damage costs of GHGs, and the uncertainties are very large. So how high does a carbon tax have to be, to be high enough to be effective? Of the order of &lt;strong&gt;€120/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt; is enough to make onshore and offshore wind cheaper than gas or coal for electricity in windier parts of the world such as Britain (that would translate to about €0.11 extra on the cost of a kWh unit of electricity from coal, for example). It's enough to make PV cheaper than coal in sunnier parts of the world. Those who've been studying capture of ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and long-term stable sinking, such as Klaus Lackner, have estimated an initial price of around &lt;strong&gt;€150/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. So, somewhere in that range (&lt;strong&gt;€120-150/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;) is probably, for now, a good estimate of the long-term equilibrium price for GHGs, given where we are at the moment. That's quite a lot higher than most carbon pricing being considered at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nicholas Stern: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/SearchResults?an=stern&amp;amp;bt.x=0&amp;amp;bt.y=0&amp;amp;sts=t&amp;amp;tn=The%20economics%20of%20climate%20change&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Economics of Climate Change : The Stern Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chris Hope: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=model%20co2%20page&amp;amp;num=50&amp;amp;as_sauthors=Chris%20Hope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a Google Scholar list of his economic work with the PAGE impact assessment model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/~kl2010/members_lackner.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Klaus Lackner&lt;/a&gt;: many papers - &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22ks%20lackner%22%20co2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here's a Google Scholar list of some of them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arthur Cecil Pigou: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econlib.org/library/NPDBooks/Pigou/pgEW.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Economics of Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/weitzman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Martin Weitzman&lt;/a&gt;: in particular, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/weitzman/files/PricesVSQuantities.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Prices versus Quantities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="104" LastEditorUserId="104" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2012-01-30T07:40:16.397" LastActivityDate="2012-01-30T07:40:16.397" CommentCount="4" />

For example, economists put a good bit of focus on the distribution of income.  In development economics, we very often consider that income varies across not only over space, but also by gender, landholder status, race and so on.  We not only break income down by sub-national boundaries, but we also estimate median household income separately for female-headed households vs male-headed households (and broken down by a variety of other factors).

How would set the interest rate for customers who want to borrow money?  One of the factors would be how much money your bank has available to lend.  If you have a substantial amount of reserves (i.e. customers making deposits by &lt;strong&gt;saving&lt;/strong&gt; money) then you would charge a lower interest rate.  The interest rate depends on how much people save.  People have to save money first before anyone is able to borrow money.  Another factor is the demand for loans from customers.  When a lot of customers start requesting loans you will raise your rate.  Thus, the interest rate is the price of borrowing money where the price is determined by supply and demand: supply being savings and demand being the amount of customers demanding loans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is how the interest rate is determined in a free market.  Having an entity, such as the FED, arbitrarily set interest rates distorts the free market price mechanism for borrowing.  The interest rate is usually set artificially low to stimulate the economy.  This causes people to take loans that would have not been possible in a free market system.  This temporarily increases economic activity as people spend the borrowed money.  But this is not sustainable since the interest rate was not set by the market.  The low interest rate was artificial and gave the illusion of savings.  The bust occurs when the borrowing starts to slow at the given rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The FED controls the interest rate through two main factors: the reserve ratio and the federal funds rate.  The FED specifies the minimum amount of reserves a bank must have on hand.  Banks can loan money until they hit the reserve ratio.  The federal funds rate is the overnight interest rate at which member banks can borrow from the FED.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with the other poster who suggested reading a college economics textbook first.

The real interest rate at time $t$, $r_t$ is simply the opportunity cost of capital.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Central banks use monetary policy to influence the performance of the macroeconomy in the short run. If a central bank lowers nominal interest ($i$) rates too much then it encounters the zero-bound problem, whereby nominal interest rates ($i$) cannot be lower than 0. Because of this, the central bank can be forced into non-orthodox measure such as Quantitative Easing and other large-scale asset purchases. In Europe, to lower the rates that sovereigns pay on their public debt, the European Central Bank is now buying up bonds. By adding to the weak demand for public debt in Europe, it hopes to increase prices and thereby lower interest rates. Remember that because these bonds are sold at discount (below par), there is an inverse relationship between the price and the interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A low real interest rate ($r_t$) will cause overindebtedness, leverage and speculative bubbles. According to many economists such as Robert Shiller (author of Irrational Exuberance), it was precisely due to a period of very low interest rates following the tech bust that the US housing boom was born. Also, in Europe, because of the euro which lowered real interest rates in many countries, a binge followed. Now many countries there (namely the PIGS, i.e, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain) are forced to deleverage, i.e. to lower their levels of debt.

We don't have any measure of how much each party believes they have gained by (or whether they are deluded in their &lt;em&gt;ex ante&lt;/em&gt; belief(s) ) but we know that the tradeoff has theoretically benefited both parties from their will to participate in trade at that price. &lt;em&gt;Non-market&lt;/em&gt; redistribution implies that at least one party in the transaction believes that they will be a loser; otherwise, acting rationally, they would have been willing to agree to some form of investment loan. What economics doesn't offer, even at the extreme end of the spectrum, is any way to quantify whether unemployable person X's desire to eat the food they need to live is worth more than rich person Y's desire to increase the amount in their savings account by $1. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a welfare economics criterion for &quot;optimal&quot; redistribution - the Kador-Hicks efficiency criterion - which suggests that aggregate social welfare can be improved if redistribution would create enough wealth to pay back those that had their wealth confiscated and still come out ahead. In other words if assets are taken from those using them inefficiently and given to those able to use them more efficiently you reach a social optimum: generally regarded as implying a net welfare gain happens even if those whose wealth was redistributed away from them are never repaid. The problems with this are: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(i) it's based on the calculation of hypothetical outcomes (what the person losing the wealth would have generated based on investments or purchases they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have made versus what the people the wealth is being transferred to will generate based on things they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; buy or invest in); it's the estimation of a policymaker rather than the belief of the participants in the redistribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(ii) if the Kaldor-Hicks optimum &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be accurately estimated it would likely indicate allowing some unproductive people to live &quot;costs&quot; more than leaving someone who invests in productive enterprises to keep the money. There's a strong argument that this is ethically wrong even if is economically &quot;optimal&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1]An market outcome in which a tax rate is announced in advance &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a &quot;free&quot; market outcome: parties have agreed to the transaction in the knowledge that the government will take x% of income and redistribute it to someone else (Despite what passionate defenders of &quot;free markets&quot; might argue, confiscation or theft are quite different). Whether raising tax rates will discourage people from exchanging goods by so much that it decreases overall tax yields is another hypothetical question that ought to be considered when determining an optimal level of redistribution. Knowledge of responses to tax changes in other times/places make this easier to guesstimate than who &quot;needs&quot; how much redistribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastActivityDate="2012-02-03T21:15:46.797" CommentCount="2" />

When the interest rate the central bank charges is positive, lowering it makes it cheaper for banks to obtain cash reserves when needed which means they can afford to loan out money to their customers at lower rates. They still want to make a profit on loaning out money though, which means charging a positive interest rate to end borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commercial banks will happily borrow as much money as the Fed is willing to lend them at negative interest rates, but they're never going to pass that on in the form of paying businesses and consumers to borrow from them. Without changing rules to compel banks to lend, commercial lenders' interest rates will never go below zero. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; change the rules to allow the public and companies that aren't banks to borrow money from the central bank within certain limits, and offer them a negative interest rate, meaning anyone that doesn't borrow the full amount is an idiot. So here's a thought experiment along those lines&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming the central bank / government want their money back (otherwise it's a subsidy not a loan), they'll need to ensure the interest rate on this consumer lending is variable - so it becomes positive in future - because no sane person would ever make repayments on a loan that gets smaller while they defer repaying. This means it'll start making sense for recipients to repay the loan in future once interest payments becom positive (or more specifically &lt;em&gt;higher than the rate of return people are able to get from investing the money&lt;/em&gt;). Obviously, wealthier people paying attention to their finances will be able to do this as soon as it makes sense for them and uncreditworthy poorer people who used the loan to finance their day-to-day spending habits won't, because they'll have spent it and need to wait for their next few paychecks to come in to repay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paying people to borrow money is essentially welfare, and non-bankrupt poorer people tending accumulate more of the repayments is essentially a highly regressive form of taxation.

Well I'd guess, since it needs to be repaid, more people would look to invest their loan than consume it resulting in a sharp rise in investment far in excess of expected levels of future consumption. Which would mean a lot of cash chasing the same opportunities (a big asset bubble), and a big crash once interest rates on the government loan go up above zero and people try to cash out to pay it back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1]It might be less damaging for poor people who are using the cash to pay off existing debt at much higher interest rates.

But please, correct me if I'm wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So given that, one important detail is that all recessions are not equal. Some bubbles bursting can have only small effects on the society overall. I do feel that government intervention helped with the dotcom bubble, but that was a small sector of society with a lot of investment. It didn't have the possible span of the the housing bubble. Basically, are we looking at a short or long recession. Is a double-dip likely? Are we facing a liquidity trap? If it's a small recession, then it will likely clear out the weaker businesses and consumers can feel more confident in the surviving businesses (think about the oh-so-pointless websites in the dotcom era). However, if it is severe enough to result in a vicious cycle of high unemployment, low consumption such as the Great Depression, then it will likely not result in anything good. In fact, it can hold an economy back from prosperity that it would otherwise be capable of achieving. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I see no evidence that these are controllable aspects of a recession. Rather, these are characteristics of the cause, and for that reason aren't really exploitable. Good things can certainly arise from a recession, but getting a good case of chicken pox when young can also make sure you don't get a deadly case when older. Still it might be better to never have to deal with chicken pox at all.

This decision &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a slightly cooling effect on the short term credit tensions but it is now backfiring (see for instance the recent negotiations regarding the &quot;voluntary&quot; PSI (private sector involvement) conditioning the new Greek bailout).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this came as a welcome relief for European banks, state bond auctions where still largely shunned by cash-strapped investors, thereby resulted in unsustainably high borrowing rates for a large proportion of Eurozone countries.&#xA;By offering refinancing to Eurozone banks at an average benchmark rate of 1% for three years (as opposed to one under Trichet), Mario Draghi created the conditions for these borrowing rates to become more sustainable.  The ECB was taking the risk, not the banks.  The risk is low anyway considering the foreseeable economic slump ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Said otherwise he bought the Eurozone time, thereby allowing Eurozone governments to legislate and implement long delayed budget deficit reduction reforms.  In other words, he shifted the battle for the Euro from the capital markets unforgiving time scale to the more convenient political one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Future will tell how political leaders will take advantage of this opportunity and show enough courage and judgement to make the best of this short reprieve.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For now, one has to admit that there has been no shortage of triumphant declarations in many Eurozone countries falsely ascribing the decrease of borrowing rates to the fable that investors were suddenly convinced by the 12th of December umpteenth-last-chance-treaty.

However Bâle III imposes higher &quot;Liquidity Coverage Ratio&quot; and &quot;Net Stable Funding Ratio&quot; which in theory would decrease the risks of bank default or at least firewall them.  And we all know that banks are currently doing all they can to collect savings and clean their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Second aspect is : is there some purpose behind it like &quot;let the market assess solvency &gt;of countries&quot; ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In effect, the banks are part of &quot;the market&quot;.

The cash flow model is useful if analyzed in the SHORT-MEDIUM outlook. I think we will both agree that nobody buys a piece of stock from a company and HOLD IT FOREVER if it SURELY knows that it will never bring any profit (revenue-costs). IF you held some stocks that u knew would never bring any profit you would want to sell it rather than hold it because you would expect nobody would want to buy it. This will drive the price of stock to zero. So stockholders of any company must have expectations of some kind of profit (even if it is purely speculative)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another reason why I used the DDM is because we treated the CONCEPT of price formation in the LONG RUN and this model also ASSUMES the company will still exist.

Risk, in economics, refers equally to the upside and the downside.  In this sense (possibly different from the common usage of the term) a possible -1 is no more risky than a possible +1.  It is not a case of an agent choosing a risky option that might lead to +1 but might also lead to -1, and preferring a certain 10.  The economic concept that is relevant, especially if 1 unit is large, is diminishing marginal utility.  However, before applying this here one other point needs clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No employer or other authority can directly award, or take away, utility.  What they can perhaps do is award or withhold money or other benefits.  This will almost certainly affect agents' utility, but the precise effect depends on each individual (utility is often said to be subjective).  So the practical question for an employer or authority is not about utility but about a monetary or other reward or punishment.  And this is where diminishing marginal utility applies: if the monetary alternatives are say, 10,000 plus a possible reward of 1,000, and 10,000 minus a possible punishment of 1,000, most people's utility will be more affected by the difference between 9,000 and 10,000 than by that between 10,000 and 11,000. There are many online sources on diminishing marginal utility: &#xA;eg &lt;a href=&quot;http://economicsconcepts.com/law_diminishing_marginal_utility.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://economicsconcepts.com/law_diminishing_marginal_utility.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also relevant here are agents' expectations.  Incentives are often sequential or periodic rather than one-off.  If an agent expects income of 10,000 and has planned his/her outgoings accordingly, they will have a strong reason to try to avoid -1,000.  Equally, however, if in the past they have regularly performed well enough to achieve +1,000, they may have adjusted their outgoings so that they have a strong incentive to keep on achieving +1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, from personal experience the presentation of incentive systems is extremely important.  Cultural and linguistic factors are likely to affect how systems are perceived.  To me at least, &quot;punishment&quot; suggests a response to wrongdoing, and if an authority attempts to punish me my reaction is likely to be to show that I have not done wrong.  If the issue is only under-performance, then some other terminology might be more appropriate, eg penalty.  Employment law in the UK at least would not allow an employer to make a deduction against a contracted salary on grounds of under-performance: hence employers who wish to offer monetary incentives have little choice but to adopt the reward option (with any punishments in other forms, eg formal warnings and ultimately dismissal).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="719" LastActivityDate="2012-02-24T15:08:00.730" CommentCount="3" />

With this we create a profit equation, take the derivative, and set it equal to zero.&#xA;$$\pi = p*(200,000-500p) - c(q)$$&#xA;$$=200,000p-500p^2 - c(q)$$&#xA;$$\frac {d\pi} {dp} = 200,000 - 1,000p - 100 = 0$$&#xA;The derivative of $c(q)$ is marginal cost, which we know to be 100, and is why I put it into the equation. Solving for p we get $p = 199.9$. Substituting that back into the demand function you gave, we find $q=100,050$, which will be the number of TVs sold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now to find what happens if we limit the TVs sold to 100,000. Plugging this into the demand function you gave, selling 100,000 TVs would increase the price to 200.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We know that $c&amp;#39;(q)=100$, so taking the anti-derivative of this gives us $c(q)=100q$. The original cost of production would have thus been $100 * 100,050 = 10,005,000$. This falls down to $100*100,000 = 10,000,000$ for our new cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And for social benefit, we measure the change in profit for our producer.&#xA;$$New_\pi=200,000*200 - 500 * 200^2 - 10,000,000 = 10,000,000$$&#xA;$$Original_\pi = 200,000*199.5 - 500 * 119.5^2 - 10,005,000= 22,754,875$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is a pretty large change in profit for such a small change in price! While producer surplus falls though, consumer surplus increases slightly, and total surplus (consumer sur. + producer surplus) falls. If you want to find consumer surplus for each scenario and then find the difference between total surplus, then you can take an integral:&#xA;$$\int_0^{quant. supp.} \! ((200,000 - 500p) - p) \, \mathrm{d} p$$&#xA;To which you insert each value of p that you need.&#xA;$$Original_{CS}= 20,039,675.25$$&#xA;$$New_{CS}=20,040,000$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="721" LastEditorUserId="721" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2012-02-27T20:59:57.817" LastActivityDate="2012-02-27T20:59:57.817" CommentCount="5" />

My estimated consumer surplus seemed low, and I’ve been considering why this might be.  This question relates to just one possible reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where a valuation relates to a remote site, eg a national park (as many published studies do), it may be a reasonable assumption to treat the value of the site in isolation.  Where a park is one of many within a city, however, the interactions between the demands for visits to different parks can hardly be ignored.  The question therefore is what exactly is the meaning of the value of an urban park estimated by the travel cost method.  Is it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a) The marginal value which that park contributes to the total value of all the city’s parks, as compared with a situation without that park but with all the other parks still present; or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;b) A value which could, in principle, be added to the equivalent values for all the other parks to estimate the total value of all the city’s parks (I avoid “average value” since an assumption of homogeneous units is implausible for parks); or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;c) Neither of the above; or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;d) Does the meaning depend on the details of how the method is applied (eg the variables included in the trip-generating function)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the answer can be (a) since, if the park had not existed, some of its visitors would instead have visited other parks within the city, choosing to make higher-cost trips or to visit parks with inferior characteristics.  Thus some of the consumer surplus a travel cost study of one park measures is not additional, but merely transferred from other parks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also don’t think the answer can be (b).  Some people may have a strong desire to visit a park, and if no alternative were available, might be willing to travel say 20 km to visit a park.  But if they live in a city where everyone is within 2 km of a park, their willingness to travel 20 km is never revealed by their behaviour.  Of course they might make much more frequent trips, but there is no particular reason to think that this would have the same effect on measured consumer surplus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My provisional thinking is that the answer is (c).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have looked at many papers on the travel cost method but have not seen this issue addressed.  Some papers – eg Rosenthal D H 1987  The Necessity for Substitute Prices in Recreation Demand Analyses  American Journal of Agricultural Economics Vol 69 No 4 pp 828-837 – refer to the inclusion of variables for substitute sites in estimating a trip-generating function for a site. It is shown that omission of substitute price variables can result in a biased estimate of the trip-generating function and therefore of a site’s value.  But this seems to be a separate point.  It concerns how potential visitors behave given a choice between two or more existing sites.  It does not address how visitors would have behaved if one or more of the sites had not existed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are of course other important kinds of site value which the travel cost method does not capture (eg hedonic property value, the value of ecosystem services) - please ignore these for the purposes of this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="719" LastEditorUserId="719" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2012-03-01T09:58:30.200" LastActivityDate="2012-04-21T03:19:31.030" Title="A question on the travel cost valuation method" Tags="&lt;microeconomics&gt;&lt;sustainability&gt;" AnswerCount="2" />

Some will be spent on coffee beans, but the rest will go on wages, taxes, rent, equipment and so on. So it's ceased to be a coffee-dollar at the time of transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there is something in what you've said. The &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/behavioral-economics&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'behavioral-economics'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;behavioral-economics&lt;/a&gt; tag here is absolutely spot on: and we must remember that although many of the concepts that behavioural economics analyses have been known to confidence tricksters / people in marketing for ages, they were outside the scope of classical economics, and have only been brought within the formal remit of the study of economics relatively recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick romp through some of the concepts I've come across that are congruent with what you're saying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within transport economics, there is sometimes discussion of a &lt;strong&gt;travel budget&lt;/strong&gt; - a relatively stable pot of time and/or money that is allocated to a household's travel, that might get switched between different journeys, but is less likely to be switched to a non-travel use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is partly wrapped up in the idea of &lt;strong&gt;satisficing&lt;/strong&gt;: that because finding the optimum incurs a transaction cost, it's actually optimal to settle for a near-optimal outcome, and that switching preferences only happens when a step-change is reached in external conditions. So, we get used to spending £X per week on food, £Y per week on travel, £Z per week on utility bills, because that's proved to be a reasonably viable allocation of our budget. And that ends up giving us a food budget, a travel budget and a utility budget that gets reinforced by habit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And there's the concept of &lt;strong&gt;price anchoring&lt;/strong&gt;: when we're looking to estimate a number, we're very suggestible. Any context-specific number we hear, anchors our expectations around that number. So, if we're used to spending, say £100 on one software licence, that's what we expect the next software licence to cost. If someone wants to pitch software at us that's £1000 for a licence, they need to re-anchor our expectations, and one way to do that is to portray their software as being in a very different category to the one we're used to buying from. That way, they can re-anchor the price expectation at a different level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, the &lt;strong&gt;sunk cost fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;: once we've spent a lump of money on the car, then we tend to be happier to spend more money on maintaining the car and keeping it operating, so that we don't feel we're wasting the lump sum already spent on it.  This can end up with us throwing good money after bad: we make irrational sub-optimal decisions to pay high maintenance costs, even though the lump sum already paid is gone and may be only recoverable in very small part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="104" LastActivityDate="2012-03-01T09:00:59.550" CommentCount="2" />

Now you can make assumptions about these measures to make your model as simple or complicated as you'd like.  To briefly explain how this works (I assume that the improvement will turn a congested roadway into a non-congested roadway):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Calculate the delay of each individual (or aggregate to some degree) in the transportation network.  This is the difference between the non-congested travel time and the actual travel time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Determine a measure of the time valuation (value-of-time) of individuals (e.g. everyone has same valuation, businesspeople have greater valuation than commuters).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Multiply each individual's delay by her value-of-time.  This gives you a measure of the time-cost of their trip (versus a non-congested trip)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sum the time-cost across the individuals in the area of interest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the total time-cost across the population, you now have the benefit in monetary terms.  To get the cost of the construction, you need to estimate this as well (probably from similar projects or perhaps a government entity has already calculated it).  Compare the construction cost to the total time-cost to determine the cost/benefit ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of your approach will depend on your assumptions, but this is the process in a nutshell.  Like a previous poster stated, people write books about the assumptions you could use and methods to use (Look at literature in transportation planning and travel demand modeling).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="763" LastActivityDate="2012-03-08T21:57:09.273" />

Over much of this period, the U.S. maintained a fixed&#xA;  dollar price for an ounce of gold, and prior to 1913 (indicated by a&#xA;  vertical line on the graph) there was no Federal Reserve System. The&#xA;  pre-Fed era was characterized by frequent episodes such as the Panic&#xA;  of 1857, Panic of 1873, Panic of 1893, Panic of 1896, and Panic of&#xA;  1907 in which even the safest borrowers would suddenly find themselves&#xA;  needing to pay a very high rate of interest. Those events were&#xA;  associated with significant financial failures and business&#xA;  contraction. After establishment of the Federal Reserve, the U.S.&#xA;  short-term interest rate became much more stable and exhibited none of&#xA;  the sudden spiking behavior that used to be so common.  ... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Even so, one of the worst economic downturns in America's history came&#xA;  on the Fed's watch in the form of the Great Depression of 1929-1933.&#xA;  But it's worth emphasizing that the U.S. was still on the gold&#xA;  standard through this period, with the price of gold fixed at $20.67&#xA;  per ounce. ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One of the problems with the gold standard is that when the real value&#xA;  of gold changes (as it does all the time) and the dollar price of an&#xA;  ounce of gold is fixed (as it must be by definition under a gold&#xA;  standard), that means dollar prices have to adjust in response to&#xA;  anything that happens to the gold market. With the economic and&#xA;  financial turbulence of the late 1920s and early 1930s, there was a&#xA;  big increase in the relative price of gold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;... Another indication that the gold standard and its attendant overall&#xA;  dollar price deflation were making our problems worse is the fact that&#xA;  the U.S. recovery began more or less immediately with the elimination&#xA;  in 1933 of the legal convertibility of dollars to gold at the price of&#xA;  $20.67. And our experience was not unique. The 14 countries that&#xA;  decided to abandon the gold standard two years earlier than the U.S.&#xA;  began their economic recovery in 1932, as seen in the top panel of the&#xA;  figure below.

Years ago this was a problem with paper money.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Easily transportable - People want to be able to walk into a store, shop, and purchase items with money they can carry on them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Historically gold and silver have met the criteria for all of the above and thus, have always proved to work well as money.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The government can turn paper into money by accepting the paper for payment of taxes.  Also, government can enact legal tender laws where the creditor must accept the government paper money for payment of debts.  Gresham's law comes into effect once the paper money enters the economy.  Gresham's law is summarized as &quot;bad money drives out good money&quot;.  People will always trade their lowest quality money first so the lower quality money drives out the higher quality money.  Once paper money appears, hard money (gold, silver, and copper) will disappear as people prefer to pay with the paper money and creditors have to accept the paper money due to legal tender laws.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that Gresham's law can drive gold and silver out of circulation also:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Coinage Act of 1792 established the US dollar as 371.25 grains of silver or 24.75 grains of gold. This established a government ratio of 15 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold. In the late 18th century there was a large production of silver from Mexico and the market ratio of silver to gold increased to 15.75 to 1 by 1805. The government ratio, however, was still 15 to 1. This was enough incentive for people to exchange their silver coins for gold coins at the government ratio, melt the gold, and sell the gold bullion overseas at the market value. Thus, gold coins disappeared from circulation as people either hoarded the gold or sent it abroad. People used the overvalued silver coins (i.e. the &quot;bad&quot; money) domestically and gold coins disappeared from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to correct the problem of disappearing gold coins the Coinage Act of 1834 was enacted. It kept the US dollar at 371.25 grains of silver but changed the definition to 23.2 grains of gold which established a government ratio of 16 to 1. This was close to the market ratio of gold to silver at the time so both gold and silver coins appeared in circulation again. The gold rush of 1849 produced a lot of gold and the market ratio of silver to gold became 15.46 to 1. Now gold was overvalued so people began exchanging their gold coins for silver coins at the government ratio, melt the silver, and sell the silver bullion overseas at the market value. People used the overvalued gold coins (i.e. the &quot;bad&quot; money) domestically and silver coins disappeared from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="165" LastActivityDate="2012-03-09T18:27:34.650" CommentCount="1" />

From the graph we indeed can conclude that the Chinese Central Bank interferes in its foreign exchange rate policy HOWEVER the exchange RATE DECREASED (which means that the CNY increased in value from 2004 when it was traded at 8.3 CNY/USD for a long time. That's a 25% increase in the value which roughly translates into the imports from China being almost 25% more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy implications:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Artificially devaluing the yuan, the Chinese make their goods less expensive (because we assume the wages and costs are in yuans) and this boosts the Chinese exports. When Exports &gt; Imports then we get a positive Net exports and the result is that the Central Bank of China increases its reserves of foreign currency. Now China has the biggest reserves of foreign currency in the world(which is a sign they don't know what to do with the money they make), the total value of their reserves being 3.18 Trillion US Dollars. That's a long way from ONLY US /$ 1.6 bln (not trillion) back in 1978.  The reserves are impressing even on the per capita basis, if we consider that China has 1.2 bln ppl we get a sum of USD 2650.

Then you could go through the liabilities of the entire banking sector of a country to spot the ammounts saved in checking accounts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This whole proccess is tedious and would provide you with little information though (how would one use such a measure?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit to add an answer regarding the &quot;lively circulating&quot; money part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EnergyNumbers is spot-on. Due to the nature of currency (if you just want to restrict yourself to just currency -coins and banknotes- as a measure of money) you can never be sure of the amount of currency in circulation. For example, if I inherit $1,000,000 in cash and burry it in my backyard, it is out of the circulation. Yet it is money that has been printed, and until the time I picked up my shovel, it was circulating. This measure of money is not interesting because it doesn't really tell us anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You ask whether it would be possible to substitute the world currency by some other, even partially. But this happened all the time in history. Most recent example: the adoption of the Euro and the abolishment of the national currencies in the eurozone. Another example: moving from trading using salt in ancient times to trading using gold. Then the crude gold became gold coins. Then these gold coins gave way to pieces of paper that assured that they can be redeemed in gold by some proto-banks in Europe. Then this paper printing which was backed by gold became a state monopoly, and a little after that, in the 20th century, the gold backed currency was dropped altogether giving way to the fiat paper money.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this sense, currency is circulating because people are willing to accept it. So if the entire population of Earth, was convinced to use matches or toothpicks for transactions then this would become a de facto currency. Such fenomena are often observed in periods of hyper-inflation: the pieces of paper called banknotes are no longer valuable and they aren't used. People turn to barter economies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what we call money and currency changes all the time.

If you need to think of it only as a currency in its own right, then think of it as pegged to the Swiss Franc. The other way to look at it, is just as a variant embodiment of the Swiss Franc, just as Swiss Franc cash deposits, time deposits, notes and coins, are variant embodiments of the Swiss Franc: the difference is, that it's not easy to take money out of WIR.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started in the global great depression of the 1930s: by trading IOUs, it served two purposes: it injected liquidity into a system where liquidity had been choked off; and it introduced some degree of protectionism, adding frictional costs to any transactions that would remove liquidity &amp;amp; wealth from the circle of WIR members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a mutual credit system, and ultimately it's backed by deposits made with the WIR bank. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/Cash_substitute_greases_business_wheels.html?cid=7613810&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;initial deposits were of very illiquid instruments&lt;/a&gt;, such as building deeds - and that enabled WIR members to inject new liquidity into their little corner of the global economy, and to keep it there, helping them trade through the liquidity crunch of the 1930s depression. More recently, it's backed by deposits of swiss francs, so WIR adds much less to liquidity than it used to, but still offers some degree of protectionism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It functions as a form of tradeable IOUs, as a trade-club, and as a credit union.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;An example from the origins of WIR&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say that one WIR member, firm A, does business with another WIR member, firm B, and offers it credit terms for the CHF 10,000 transaction. Now firm B owes firm A CHF 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firm B can settle that debt by paying firm A CHF 10,000. Or it can trade that whole debt with other WIR-members that owe it (firm B) money.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to take the latter case, if firm C owes firm B CHF 4,000, and firm D owes firm B CHF 6,000, and all are WIR members, then firm C can &quot;pass on&quot; respective portions of its debt to firm A, on to firms C and D.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that, firm B doesn't owe firm A anything. Firms C and D don't owe firm B anything. Firm C owes firm A CHF 4,000. And firm D owes firm A CHF 6,000. Even though firms C and D have never done business with firm A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;And today&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The WIR bank acts as intermediary / broker for all of this, keeping track of all the transactions: all it needs to track, is that firm A is now owed CHF 10,000; and firms C and D owe CHF 4,000 and CHF 6,000 respectively. It is the counter-party in each of these debts - so firm A can spends its CHP 10,000 via its WIR bank credit card, at any business that's also a member of the WIR. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(there is a refinement, where a firm can make payment partly in Swiss Francs, and partly in WIR-credit, but I don't want to over-complicate things here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also borrow money from the WIR bank; and, as it's a co-operative, the interest rates are very low.

By doing that, there is no further need to print money as there are no longer threats to their economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, the problem is, that if they put a cap such that the Swiss Franc becomes too cheap, then there will be massive inflow of money, but this time it will not be to buy and hold the Swiss Franc, but to buy Swiss products.&#xA;If that where to happen the SNB should stop its policy right away, else prices will increase very quickly (inflation) as the SNB prints money to match the demand from foreign firms to buy Swiss products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have to keep in mind that the reason behind having floating currencies is because the rate of exchange of currencies can adjust itself very quickly when the whole economy behind it can't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example: Salaries are not adjusted of a daily basis and can remain too low while the inflation put the price higher, there exists contract that can fix prices of certain good a certain period, factories cannot be adjusted quickly to the new supply/demand, if money looses value to quickly then lending won't be done on long period, etc....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to assess the inflation risk, you can monitor the Foreign reserve of the Swiss Cenral Bank (I think that you can find this information on their website).

However, as with the current situation with Medicare, some programs become underfunded despite a provided funding mechanism, and then usually rely on general funds to make up the difference.

The first point I will argue is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.couchsurfing.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CouchSurfing&lt;/a&gt; (CS) is an example of crowd-sourcing impacting a capital-intensive industry but has realistic limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CS allows people to &quot;host&quot; traveling strangers on their couch, and no payment is exchanged.  The exact reason they do this is complicated, but the act of traveling itself has a high social status associated with it (look at any site where people post self-descriptions and you will find many mentions), and the act of hosting is taken as a worldly thing to do that enables other travelers while also increasing the world knowledge of the host themselves.  Also, hosting people makes it more likely that you will &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; hosted by other people, since the profiles prominently display references from previous hosts and travelers.  In this way, a pay-it-forward system is self-enforcing because anyone can evaluate on their own whether or not the traveler has contributed enough to the community to justify their generosity.  People use CS as an alternative to hotels.  Hotels require staffing, but the cost composition is mostly in the capital cost of the real estate.  The industry, as a whole is uniformly denied revenue by the existence of CS.  The value that CS provides, of course, wasn't created from nothing, but it did come from the under-utilization of real estate assets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This last argument isn't unique to CS.  While CS has been growing since 2006, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airbnb.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; is a for-profit company that emerged in late 2009.  The rules of Airbnb are similar to CS (peer-to-peer, references, mentality) but hosts receive a payment.  Here is a quick Google Trends comparison (which doesn't reflect usage directly).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Red - Airbnb&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Blue - CouchSurfing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/L8Gsr.png&quot; alt=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, both of these are &quot;crowd sourced&quot;, but one of them is completely free and one of them is not.  That is to say, the non-free option emerged as an alternative to the free option.  My guess, however, is that Airbnb didn't detract from the usage rate of CS, but instead took more business from the hotel industry (which is still probably large in comparison).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For one last example of &lt;strong&gt;capital efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;, look at one of the most common examples given by advocates of collaborative consumption.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQa3kUJPEko&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;They say that a power drill is only used a few minutes in its lifetime, so sharing it is dramatically more efficient&lt;/a&gt;.  In order for us to make economic sense of this all, we must speak of &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt;.  The proposition is that the value of the power tool is the use of the tool (and not the ownership of it).  In that sense, increasing capital efficiency has increased the value we have access to.  In a more dubious sense, we may say it allows us to consume more with higher efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The example of &lt;a href=&quot;http://market.swap.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Swap Tree&lt;/a&gt; is an extreme example because it is so heavily oriented around trading media items, including DVDs and books.  Media can already be traded at almost no cost between consumers, which is a story we've seen before.  In that case, the production of intellectual products is almost completely disconnected with the cost to consume them.  Capital has argued that they need protection from this trading.  Developers of video game have complained about used game trading because it reduces demand for their product.  You are probably familiar with a similar infamous fight the recording industry waged.  Ultimately, the same argument can (and might) be made regarding power tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;capital changes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is easier to argue than the case of labor.  Ultimately it's the total demand that gets squeezed, but the effect is seen sharply by capital because capital represents an asset that has already been invested in and can decrease in value as a result of sharing and crowdsourcing tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other part of the argument is that people now have greater purchasing power - they can consume more.  This would then increase demand elsewhere.  Where?  Nobody knows, but it should bid up prices wherever that is temporarily, and expand those industries permanently long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is, unless people work less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;labor changes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interesting reference to make is The Zeitgeist Movement, which vehemently argues that &lt;strong&gt;technological unemployment&lt;/strong&gt; is a major problem.  They go on to argue that a different economic system is needed to accommodate the dramatic efficiency gains to come.  A careful reading of the crowdsourcing projects shows that technology plays a large part in their existence and usefulness.  Wikipedia, for instance, could not have existed before the wiki software was developed.  On another less trivial level, CouchSurfing itself would be dramatically more difficult without the existence of mobile communication and computing devices (which coincided with its rise).  It may be useful to look at this as a balance between technology and labor in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also possible that technological unemployment is a complete myth.  With greater means, people will likely consume more, in fact, that is inevitable.  This may not be true, however, if they work less.  Are all the hours spent on Wikipedia hours that would otherwise be spent on leisure?  I doubt it is either 100% leisure of work time that is sacrificed.  I think we would be looking at a model where people:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consume more&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consume at higher efficiency&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Work less&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Spend time &quot;contributing&quot; which takes away from both other leisure and work&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the last point, I think these are characteristic of any gain in affluence, although whether or not such gains collapse labor markets is still an open question.  As to whether crowdsourcing can collapse &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; labor market, I think the answer is clearly that it can.  In terms of the total labor market, it depends on your view of technological unemployment.  That is, unless you believe crowsourcing can solve that problem as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="806" LastActivityDate="2012-03-30T16:42:44.193" />

But crowd-sourcing by definition needs a crowd to source from. Voluntary activity can often have, as its own reward, the building of a direct link between volunteer and beneficiary. Whereas within crowd-sourcing, there is a much greater gap between volunteer and beneficiary. For example, it's unlikely that I'll ever meet more than one or two of the people whose questions I've answered on StackExchange. So, the reward/motivation (accepting that those are two subtly different things) must be coming from somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;1) Does crowd-sourcing require a network effect?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Not necessarily, but they do often go together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It is possible to find crowd-sourcing without network effects - for example some charitable fund-raising - that's a type of crowd-sourcing that (I expect) long pre-dates the coining of the term &quot;crowd-sourcing&quot;.  But crowd-sourcing as applied to other activities does tend to go hand-in-hand with network effects. The very infrastructure that enables crowd-sourcing, also enables things like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;construction of avatars (in the broader sense of a dedicated additional identity, rather than in the narrow sense of a graphical icon);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;linking of those avatars to individual specific contributions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;accumulation of a quantitative or qualitative indicator of domain-specific contribution (reputation, experience points, karma points, achievement badges, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And all of those things help establish network effects. So, although crowd-sourcing doesn't need network effects in play directly, it certainly can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;2) Does crowd-sourcing collapse a labour market?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL; DR It can. Or it can create new employment markets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In theory, crowd-sourcing should open up new economic efficiencies, leading to a greater economic benefit on the whole (though not necessarily to all). It can result in structural changes (e.g. as mentioned in another answer, stock photography), and, like any structural change, that can result in some kind of structural job-losses.  In the long run, it will lead to greater net social welfare, but as to where those benefits accrue, that's a political decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it may be that an industry grows from something that had only been of very very minor economic value previously, so it is conceivable that crowd-sourcing can create net new jobs. For example, protein-folding was never a big source of employment. And yet sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://fold.it/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fold-it&lt;/a&gt; have allowed the execution of what is typically (but not exclusively) very low economic-value work; and the fold-it site itself requires staff to run it, and once in a rare while, the new knowledge obtained will result in new products and new employment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="104" LastActivityDate="2012-03-31T09:11:51.523" CommentCount="1" />

This is particularly true in developing countries where people have limited flexibility in changing their career paths. Therefore, deliberately causing a recession seems to have very negative repercussions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The assumption that one must make about the positive effects of recession is that the government is able to implement structural reforms during the recession that would lead to higher economic growth later on.

Imagine a coal&#xA;miner who gets paid with coal. Whenever he wants to buy anything,&#xA;first he must find a person that has the item he wants &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; this very&#xA;same person has to want coal in order for the transaction to be&#xA;carried out. (This is called the problem of double coincidence of&#xA;wants.) Because the miner is likely to have a hard time finding people&#xA;to trade with, he will work less and produce less coal than he&#xA;otherwise would if he was paid with money. So, if money becomes very&#xA;scarce, it could get to a point where trade becomes difficult and&#xA;production levels fall. Something like this happened after World War&#xA;II, when most European countries had run out of foreign reserves and&#xA;that prevented them from engaging in international trade and the&#xA;economy from recovering. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, money is a store of value. Deflation means that prices go down&#xA;or, what is the same, that every unit of money can buy more as time&#xA;goes by. Therefore people may refrain from spending, in the hope that&#xA;they will be able to spend more in the future, because the purchasing&#xA;power of money increases with time. So, it is conceivable that&#xA;deflation can reduce spending temporarily, although personally I&#xA;haven't got concrete evidence of this happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, money is a unit of account. This means that prices are&#xA;expressed in units of money. If the amount of money relative to the&#xA;amount of goods and services varies, then all prices have to be&#xA;adjusted accordingly. Now, some economists say that not all prices&#xA;adjust at the same speed (the theory of &quot;sticky prices&quot;). For instance, we know that the price of oil&#xA;changes daily, whereas wages adjust at a much slower rate. If this&#xA;happens, it can make resources to be re-allocated according to the new&#xA;relative prices. Again, I can't think of any concrete example where&#xA;this effect has been measured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="870" LastActivityDate="2012-04-13T11:19:28.743" CommentCount="2" />

Lotteries have higher overhead since you have to give out prize money.

If you believe Daniel Hamermesh's results, attractive people earn more, so they would also cost more to hire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other issue is that it takes a lot of human capital to run an organization capably. NPOs compete with the FPOs for this talent. Obviously someone might be willing to accept a smaller salary in order to spend their time helping people and there are non-pecuniary lifestyle considerations as well, but  NPOs have to absorb some of that opportunity cost to stay competitive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I guess this is really an empirical issue.

The current system is so out of line with the kind of economy that would likely develop out of a hard-money (e.g., gold-based) system, that any &lt;em&gt;meaningful&lt;/em&gt; adoption of &lt;em&gt;gold&lt;/em&gt; (or pick your hard asset of choice) into the monetary system would probably bring the current order to a screeching halt.  If banks actually &lt;em&gt;had to have&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;money they &quot;have&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, not only would every-single one of today's banks cease to exist, but likewise &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of businesses would be taken down with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the important thing to understand is, many (most?) of these businesses are only made possible by such an economic order, and (in my opinion) do not deserve to exist in the first place...  What most people arguing &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; a sound-money system (e.g., a &quot;gold standard&quot;) fail to see is, these businesses exist &lt;em&gt;at the expense&lt;/em&gt; of other businesses and ventures that could have been possible in an alternative scenario (Frédéric Bastiat's &quot;What Is Not Seen&quot;); and, these businesses would have been more likely to be producing goods and services more in line with what people actually want.  That is, without &quot;cheap money&quot; (which is a product of an artificially-lowered interest rate, which is only possible without a 100% gold- or commodity-based money), businesses would have to get their money directly from consumers/clients, or sport business models which would require them to be more prudent and realistic than today's (artificial) interest rates require.  People will argue that &lt;em&gt;fewer businesses&lt;/em&gt; would get loans then -- which is probably true -- &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; fewer businesses would &lt;em&gt;need loans&lt;/em&gt; because it would be much easier to fund yourself (and your business) on savings in a world where your money doesn't melt away month-by-month and year-by-year (due to inflation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to come back to my original point: I believe (as would about anyone advocating a &quot;gold standard&quot; that has a firm understanding of all the facets involved) that &lt;em&gt;for most people&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;in the long run&lt;/em&gt;, a commodity-based money is &lt;em&gt;&quot;good&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.  However, if a &quot;gold standard&quot; were adopted overnight -- that is, a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;, 100%, no-fractional-reserve-banking gold standard -- it would be &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of people, &lt;em&gt;in the short run&lt;/em&gt;.  But to speak of going from where we are today to a 100% gold standard is fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note, I use quotation marks when saying &quot;gold standard&quot;.  This is because there is no one &quot;gold standard&quot;; rather, it's a lose term used to describe a monetary unit that has &lt;em&gt;some relation&lt;/em&gt; to gold.  Be aware 100% gold-backed money, with no fractional-reserve banking allowed (at least not beyond the extent which the market will naturally allow) has never existed in the United States.  Some people will use this fact to argue that a &quot;gold standard&quot; won't prevent recessions/depressions because the U.S. had such a &quot;standard&quot; in the past and these economic downturns still occurred.  This is missing the full picture though; bank notes (if not state-created &quot;money&quot; or credit as well) have always been issued in excess to the underlying gold reserves of banks and governments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's my belief, and that of the Austrian Economists, that were we to live in a world (a country, state, whatever) that used a 100% gold-backed money (or, literally used gold itself as money), we would be more or less free of the wretches of wide-scale economic downturns the world is so used to and takes as a given today.

However, more&#xA;  recently, Elinor Ostrom has documented several cases showing that the tragedy of the commons was not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Joint stewardship to protect the commons&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ostrom went on, in her Nobel-winning research, to document the circumstances in the commons were protected, and negative externalities curbed. From the same article as above:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In many cases, communities had formed joint-stewardship agreements to&#xA;  sustainably manage common resources, such as fishing grounds, groundwater supplies, and grazing commons. They used frequent mutual monitoring and discussions between themselves to ensure that agreements were kept, and offenders were sanctioned with penalties determined and agreed in advance by all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here is as far as we can get in answering the question: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;how &quot;bad&quot; (as quantitatively as is possible for such a normative judgement) does it get before the market responds?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From experience, some times the market simply does not respond, until the marginal damage cost gets so high as to equal a market participant's mitigation costs: that is, the point at which the commons have deteriorated so far that it's profitable for individuals to intervene.  Joint-stewardship agreements can prevent things getting that bad, but only if specific structures and circumstances are in place to enable those agreements to form. In many cases they are not there, and hence the destruction of the commons documented by Hardin, Aristotle and others. In other words, sometimes market failure is terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These joint-stewardship agreements have also been done at the global level - for example the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.multilateralfund.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Montreal Protocol&lt;/a&gt; protecting the ozone layer.

Thus, each member of the group has incentive to encourage other members to repay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The group lending mechanism has been extensively studied.  A key article on how the peer lending mechanism works is by &lt;a href=&quot;http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/mghatak/jde1.pdf&quot;&gt;Ghatak (1999)&lt;/a&gt;.  In micro-finance environments, there is often a problem of information asymmetry: the lender can't simply pull a credit report.  Group lending causes borrowers to select team members according to local information on their ability to repay.  That is, low risk borrowers will choose a team that is also low-risk (and exclude high-risk borrowers).  At the risk of oversimplifying, the idea is that a high-risk group member, knowing that his collaborators are less likely to repay, will be unwilling to accept relatively large loans.  Thus, groups self-select appropriate loan packages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In environments where collateral is available (e.g. in transitioning economies), more traditional contractual methods are employed.  That is, borrowers put up assets to secure the loan.  In other areas, a committee is established to guarantee loans at the village level, and to provide a character reference for the potential borrower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A final feature of many of these loans is an often weekly repayment schedule, beginning immediately after loan initiation.  It was once explained to me that this is helpful for people who aren't used to formal financial arrangements--to get them into the habit of repaying immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" LastActivityDate="2011-11-30T02:35:23.273" CommentCount="2" />

Let me give you the basic intuition behind two main theories of why group lending works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first explanation, which is an &lt;strong&gt;adverse selection&lt;/strong&gt; story attributable to Ghatak (1999) and Van Tassel (1999), suggests that group lending works because borrowers have more information about each other than the lender does. When the lender asks borrowers to form groups, they sort themselves into groups of &quot;good&quot; borrowers and &quot;bad&quot; borrowers (roughly speaking, &quot;good&quot; borrowers want to form groups with other borrowers like themselves, leaving the &quot;bad&quot; borrowers to form groups on their own). As a result, within one or two loan cycles the wheat is separated from the chaff and repayment rates soar, simply because only the best credit risks remain in the borrower pool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second explanation, which is a more common &lt;strong&gt;moral hazard&lt;/strong&gt; story, argues that monitoring borrowers is hard, both during the project and afterwards, when the bank needs to figure out whether the project was successful. When there is group liability, borrowers monitor each other, ensuring that repayment rates are high. The important insight here is that microcredit institutions are tapping into the so-called &lt;strong&gt;social capital&lt;/strong&gt; of the borrowers: even though the banks cannot punish the borrowers who don't have any collateral, other group members impose &lt;strong&gt;social sanctions&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure repayment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" LastActivityDate="2011-11-30T06:03:50.010" />
