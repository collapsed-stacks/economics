We talked a fair bit about factors affecting demand, what could push the curve outwards, selecting a price point given a curve, etc., but nothing about what determines the shape of the curve.  And that's why I asked the question.</p>\n\n<p>My introductory paragraph was intended to indicate that the very basics, like <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">segmentation</a>, weren't the subject of the question.

I don't consider the current answers satisfactory in that regard; I'd like to see more information like <a href=\"http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/9/what-determines-the-shape-of-the-demand-curve#comment-14\">Ryan's comment on MikeRand's answer</a>.

I would be extremely surprised if he skipped anything basic or fundamental in his course.</p>\n\n<p>Being on the receiving end of Joel Spolsky's first downvote on a new site is kind of exciting, I suppose, but I'd prefer to have my question open and answerable :P (edit: the community has re-opened it, thanks to several of you for the good answers and explication).  I totally agree with avoiding basic questions, but I don't think this is what you're making it out to be.

The definition questions are honestly pretty terrible, but the immense gulf between them and your ideal makes the definition phase completely worthless.  I've been through several beta launches but nothing has struck me as quite this pointless.  Check out the top 4 definition questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/1845#1845\">What was Milton Friedman's position on why the Great Depression happened?</a></p>\n\n<p>If not general reference, this is certainly not an expert question.  The answer would just be copy-pasted facts; there's no room for applying expertise in relating someone else's opinion.  Any layman could read someone's opinion and summarize it.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/2131#2131\">What is a prime example of \"the tragedy of the commons\"?</a></p>\n\n<p>List question, subjective, basic &mdash; you name it, this question's got it.  Interesting, maybe; expert, no.  The Wikipedia article even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#Modern_commons\" rel=\"nofollow\">has good examples</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/7726#7726\">What is a sunk cost?</a></p>\n\n<p>This would get so many \"Google it\" comments you'd have to lock the post.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/2126#2126\">What is the \"permanent income hypothesis\"?</a></p>\n\n<p>Slightly more interesting than the last, but the first Google hit is Wikipedia and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_income_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">the article</a>'s pretty decent.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I honestly don't understand the rationale behind signing up a bunch of people who ask and are interested in these sort of questions and then expecting them to churn out super-expert questions.

For example, here's some of the questions you left open:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-are-some-of-the-options-and-consequences-available-to-greece\">What are some of the options and consequences available to Greece?</a></p>\n\n<p>This was covered in my first year macroeconomics class (ECON 102).</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/13/how-does-the-perfect-competition-model-break-down-when-one-of-the-six-assumptions\">How does the perfect competition model break down when one of the six assumptions is lost?</a></p>\n\n<p>This was covered in my first year microeconomics class (ECON 101).</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/43/important-flaws-and-alternatives-to-the-homo-oeconomicus\">Important flaws and alternatives to the &quot;Homo oeconomicus&quot;</a></p>\n\n<p>Addressed in both of the above courses.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nothing hurts a site more than making the experts think that the site is stupid or intended for beginners.

The experts will enjoy crap questions as long at they're not posted during the private beta?  That's bizarre.  There might be some sort of lock-in effect &mdash; experts who get active early may be more reluctant to leave later &mdash; but there are at least two counters to that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The experts will feel suckered.

Attempting to trick them into believing this site is for experts only to allow the beginners to inundate the site later can't go over well.</p></li>\n<li><p>The initial experts aren't enough.  There are two few people on the site right now for it to be viable long-term, so we have to grow.  To grow, we need to be attractive to new users.  If we want those new users to be experts, then we will <strong>always</strong> need to avoid the \"stupid beginner questions\".  If not, then the site's not a site for experts anyways so why do we care about them at all?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the site really is for experts, it needs to cater to them consistently. This mixed message nonsense makes the site unusable for anyone.  And aren't the biggest sites in the network the ones that don't cater only to PhDs?  Didn't SO allow terrible questions once and still manage to get huge and attract the likes of Eric Lippert?  (I'm not advocating bad questions, just pointing out that the logic isn't 100% sound here.)</p>\n\n<p>In summary: I'm really confused, and I can only assume others are too.

For what it's worth, I have quite a lot of economics background - a graduate-level economics background, in particular. I'm hoping to make a career out of economic research at the frontier of knowledge and methodology, if I can help it. I'm just about to enter the \"research\" phase of my PhD, and would absolutely love to have a site where I can ask (and answer!) questions that are either research-related or \"theory-backed policy or analysis\"-related (heck empirical questions would be fine too). That'd be great. </p>\n\n<p>Something that I (and friends of mine) been trying to figure out since the beta launch is \"what level\" this SE site is aiming for. Saying that a site should have questions in the range </p>\n\n<pre><code>\"Econ 101\" &lt; ideal question &lt;= graduate-level/post-graduate-level questions\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is a pretty big range. </p>\n\n<p>I mention this, of course, because I just witnessed what appears to be a pretty legitimate research-level-type <a href=\"http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/246/what-have-economists-written-about-the-recent-rise-in-income-inequality\">question attacked</a> for not including what the person was asking about -- references to literature about that topic.</p>\n\n<p>I definitely consider that question to be a \"literature review\" type question, which I welcome and have no problem with. Here's why: part of being an expert in something means knowing that particular literature well. At the same time, you explicitly <em>don't</em> know the literature of other sub-fields well. That's fine, that's how being a researcher is designed. Expert in a narrow area and all. There is no shame in asking an expert in another sub-field what the literature in that field is. Thus the response to the question, that it should essentially <em>include</em> literature in its phrasing, strikes me as strange -- for a research-related site.</p>\n\n<p>The response to the question makes a lot of sense, of course, if the site is supposed to be a place for people to debate current topics. \"Back up your terminology!\" and all. I was under the impression that that's not the point of this site, though.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like that would actually make research economists <em>not</em> want to post any \"literature review\" type questions here. Am I going to be shot down for not linking to literature in my question about literature? </p>\n\n<p>The other thing that prompted my question is that, as I was reading the above debate, another friend of mine -- doing economic research at the PhD level and following the site -- sent me a message: \"looks like no ones answered <a href=\"http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/143/price-adjustment-mechanism-for-market-clearing-in-hansens-1985-real-business\">your question</a> yet. You think anyone will?\"</p>\n\n<p>Not that I'm demanding my question be answered. I actually have an answer to my question, but wasn't sure if it was poor form to answer my own Q. But my friend's timing was pretty much perfect, and it motivated me enough to stop my current work and head over here to meta.economics.  Is my question the wrong sort of question to ask?

But let me know if you disagree. </p>\n\n<p><strong>(In?)famous paper</strong>:  The answer was obvious as I recalled having the referenced paper (Edlund and Korn) in my files (he was originally asking if there was any research on this topic).   The paper is a curiosity indeed, and is worth reading if only for the attention it received when originally published.  Further, while it seems quite a bit off, it did appear in the JPE <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/324390\" rel=\"nofollow\">(2002 v10 n1)</a>, which by itself makes the paper relevant (but not necessarily right of course).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Paper taken seriously</strong>: E&amp;K's paper has been taken seriously in serious journals, for example by Arunachalam and Shah (AER 2008) who call it a \"seminal paper.\"  Their main objection is to E&amp;K's simplifying assumption that a prostitute cannot later marry, a claim for which they find no empirical evidence.  They assert an \"alternative hypothesis\" to explain sex workers' relatively high wages: that the profession exposes its workers to a higher risk (they focus on STDs).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Criteria for Judging the Worth of a Model</strong>: Instead of just summarizing the results. I went through the paper in some detail, trying to highlight some of the assumptions they made.  I think I made it pretty clear that some of the assumptions are unrealistic (and even offensive).  But if we are to exclude literature with unrealistic assumptions then that will very much limit the set of economics papers we can use on this site.  The usual process is to think about a model in the context of its assumptions--that is, just what insights we can take from a model are limited by the assumptions.  The usual criterion is not whether the model is right, but whether any useful insights can be gained from it.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 26, "LastEditorUserId": 26, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-12-07T02:29:23.647", "LastActivityDate": "2011-12-07T02:29:23.647", "CommentCount": 2}
