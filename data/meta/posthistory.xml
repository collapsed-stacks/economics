So, I submit that while the question may be within the domain of economics, some potential answers might not be.

We talked a fair bit about factors affecting demand &amp;mdash; what could push the curve outwards, selecting a price point given a curve, etc. &amp;mdash; but nothing about what determines the shape of the curve.  And that's why I asked the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My introductory paragraph was intended to indicate that the very basics, like [segmentation](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html), weren't the subject of the question.  You yourself said:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;You can't really find out what the demand curve is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The more you learn about pricing, the less you seem to know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, understanding the shape of the curve for the purposes of pricing seems like a complex endeavor (at least to you and me, anyways :P).  I don't consider the current answers satisfactory in that regard; I'd like to see more information like [Ryan's comment on MikeRand's answer](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/9/what-determines-the-shape-of-the-demand-curve#comment-14).  It mentions Engel curves and Veblen/Giffen goods, things that are **definitely** not mentioned in my microeconomics class.  [My professor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Smith_(economics)) is no slouch, either.  I would be extremely surprised if he skipped anything basic or fundamental in his course.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being on the receiving end of Joel Spolsky's first downvote on a new site is kind of exciting, I suppose, but I'd prefer to have my question open and answerable :P.  I totally agree with avoiding basic questions, but I don't think this is what you're making it out to be.  If it doesn't meet the standard, that's fine, but obviously the standard would be higher than merely &quot;beyond ECON 101&quot; in that case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If that ***is*** the case, I'll have to ask the SE team to cancel my commitment to this site, because this is not what I foresaw.  The definition questions are honestly pretty terrible, but the immense gulf between them and your ideal makes the definition phase completely worthless.  I've been through several beta launches but nothing has struck me as quite this pointless.  Check out the top 4 definition questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What was Milton Friedman's position on why the Great Depression happened?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/1845#1845)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If not general reference, this is certainly not an expert question.  The answer would just be copy-pasted facts; there's no room for applying expertise in relating someone else's opinion.  Any layman could read someone's opinion and summarize it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What is a prime example of &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot;?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/2131#2131)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  List question, subjective, basic &amp;mdash; you name it, this question's got it.  Interesting, maybe; expert, no.  The Wikipedia article even [has good examples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#Modern_commons).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What is a sunk cost?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/7726#7726)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This would get so many &quot;Google it&quot; comments you'd have to lock the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What is the &quot;permanent income hypothesis&quot;?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/2126#2126)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Slightly more interesting than the last, but the first Google hit is Wikipedia and [the article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_income_hypothesis)'s pretty decent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I honestly don't understand the rationale behind signing up a bunch of people who ask and are interested in these sort of questions and then expecting them to churn out super-expert questions.  It doesn't help that [the Research Economics proposal](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/24653/research-economics) is still open.  If all the Master's and Doctorate students are here, what's the point of that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally: Whatever the guideline is, it needs to be made clearer.  For example, here's some of the questions you left open:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-are-some-of-the-options-and-consequences-available-to-greece&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This was covered in my first year macroeconomics class (ECON 102).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/13/how-does-the-perfect-competition-model-break-down-when-one-of-the-six-assumptions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This was covered in my first year microeconomics class (ECON 101).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/43/important-flaws-and-alternatives-to-the-homo-oeconomicus&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Addressed in both of the above courses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary: I'm really confused, and I can only assume others are too.  Including you guys at SE, or otherwise this would be sorted out.  I mean that constructively." />

When questions have political implications, we tend to avoid making any normative conclusions--we don't say what is better/worse, but rather limit ourselves to if/then statements.

This is quite different from the answers people generally expect, and is a great opportunity to demonstrate how economic thinking really works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my opinion, answers to such questions should rely on well-known models or empirical evidence (like the Wikipedia prohibition on &quot;original research&quot;), and the answer should define the limits of the conclusions.  This will be a very difficult task as it is hard to communicate that models are abstractions, that our insights usually come from these abstractions, and that they can lend certain insights but usually cannot give authoritative answers.

And that's why I asked the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My introductory paragraph was intended to indicate that the very basics, like [segmentation](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html), weren't the subject of the question.

I don't consider the current answers satisfactory in that regard; I'd like to see more information like [Ryan's comment on MikeRand's answer](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/9/what-determines-the-shape-of-the-demand-curve#comment-14).  It mentions Engel curves and Veblen/Giffen goods, things that are **definitely** not mentioned in my microeconomics class.

The definition questions are honestly pretty terrible, but the immense gulf between them and your ideal makes the definition phase completely worthless.  I've been through several beta launches but nothing has struck me as quite this pointless.  Check out the top 4 definition questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What was Milton Friedman's position on why the Great Depression happened?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/1845#1845)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If not general reference, this is certainly not an expert question.  The answer would just be copy-pasted facts; there's no room for applying expertise in relating someone else's opinion.  Any layman could read someone's opinion and summarize it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What is a prime example of &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot;?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/2131#2131)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  List question, subjective, basic &amp;mdash; you name it, this question's got it.  Interesting, maybe; expert, no.  The Wikipedia article even [has good examples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#Modern_commons).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What is a sunk cost?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/7726#7726)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This would get so many &quot;Google it&quot; comments you'd have to lock the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What is the &quot;permanent income hypothesis&quot;?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/2126#2126)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Slightly more interesting than the last, but the first Google hit is Wikipedia and [the article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_income_hypothesis)'s pretty decent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I honestly don't understand the rationale behind signing up a bunch of people who ask and are interested in these sort of questions and then expecting them to churn out super-expert questions.  It doesn't help that [the Research Economics proposal](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/24653/research-economics) is still open.

If you aren't an economist, that's fine. Wait until after the private beta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does that really make sense?  The experts will enjoy crap questions as long at they're not posted during the private beta?  That's bizarre.  There might be some sort of lock-in effect &amp;mdash; experts who get active early may be more reluctant to leave later &amp;mdash; but there are at least two counters to that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The experts will feel suckered.

We talked a fair bit about factors affecting demand, what could push the curve outwards, selecting a price point given a curve, etc., but nothing about what determines the shape of the curve.  And that's why I asked the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My introductory paragraph was intended to indicate that the very basics, like [segmentation](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html), weren't the subject of the question.  You yourself said:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;You can't really find out what the demand curve is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The more you learn about pricing, the less you seem to know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, understanding the shape of the curve for the purposes of pricing seems like a complex endeavor (at least to you and me, anyways :P).  I don't consider the current answers satisfactory in that regard; I'd like to see more information like [Ryan's comment on MikeRand's answer](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/9/what-determines-the-shape-of-the-demand-curve#comment-14).  It mentions Engel curves and Veblen/Giffen goods, things that are **definitely** not mentioned in my microeconomics class.  [My professor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Smith_(economics)) is no slouch, either.  I would be extremely surprised if he skipped anything basic or fundamental in his course.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being on the receiving end of Joel Spolsky's first downvote on a new site is kind of exciting, I suppose, but I'd prefer to have my question open and answerable :P (edit: the community has re-opened it, thanks to several of you for the good answers and explication).  I totally agree with avoiding basic questions, but I don't think this is what you're making it out to be.  If it doesn't meet the standard, that's fine, but obviously the standard would be higher than merely &quot;beyond ECON 101&quot; in that case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If that ***is*** the case, I'll have to ask the SE team to cancel my commitment to this site, because this is not what I foresaw.  The definition questions are honestly pretty terrible, but the immense gulf between them and your ideal makes the definition phase completely worthless.  I've been through several beta launches but nothing has struck me as quite this pointless.  Check out the top 4 definition questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What was Milton Friedman's position on why the Great Depression happened?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/1845#1845)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If not general reference, this is certainly not an expert question.  The answer would just be copy-pasted facts; there's no room for applying expertise in relating someone else's opinion.  Any layman could read someone's opinion and summarize it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What is a prime example of &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot;?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/2131#2131)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  List question, subjective, basic &amp;mdash; you name it, this question's got it.  Interesting, maybe; expert, no.  The Wikipedia article even [has good examples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#Modern_commons).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What is a sunk cost?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/7726#7726)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This would get so many &quot;Google it&quot; comments you'd have to lock the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [What is the &quot;permanent income hypothesis&quot;?](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1618/economics/2126#2126)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Slightly more interesting than the last, but the first Google hit is Wikipedia and [the article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_income_hypothesis)'s pretty decent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I honestly don't understand the rationale behind signing up a bunch of people who ask and are interested in these sort of questions and then expecting them to churn out super-expert questions.  It doesn't help that [the Research Economics proposal](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/24653/research-economics) is still open.  If all the Master's and Doctorate students are here, what's the point of that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally: Whatever the guideline is, it needs to be made clearer.  For example, here's some of the questions you left open:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-are-some-of-the-options-and-consequences-available-to-greece&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This was covered in my first year macroeconomics class (ECON 102).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/13/how-does-the-perfect-competition-model-break-down-when-one-of-the-six-assumptions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This was covered in my first year microeconomics class (ECON 101).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/43/important-flaws-and-alternatives-to-the-homo-oeconomicus&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Addressed in both of the above courses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Nothing hurts a site more than making the experts think that the site is stupid or intended for beginners. I can't think how many people who would have made those sites great but did not participate because well-meaning private-beta participants filled the site up with a bunch of really basic questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Don't let this happen here. If you aren't an economist, that's fine. Wait until after the private beta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does that really make sense?  The experts will enjoy crap questions as long at they're not posted during the private beta?  That's bizarre.  There might be some sort of lock-in effect &amp;mdash; experts who get active early may be more reluctant to leave later &amp;mdash; but there are at least two counters to that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The experts will feel suckered.  They can come here and read what you're saying, you know.  Attempting to trick them into believing this site is for experts only to allow the beginners to inundate the site later can't go over well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The initial experts aren't enough.

If we want those new users to be experts, then we will **always** need to avoid the &quot;stupid beginner questions&quot;.  If not, then the site's not a site for experts anyways so why do we care about them at all?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the site really is for experts, it needs to cater to them consistently. This mixed message nonsense makes the site unusable for anyone.  And aren't the biggest sites in the network the ones that don't cater only to PhDs?  Didn't SO allow terrible questions once and still manage to get huge and attract the likes of Eric Lippert?  (I'm not advocating bad questions, just pointing out that the logic isn't 100% sound here.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary: I'm really confused, and I can only assume others are too.

This is something we know, and we would no more search for a citation on this fact than we would find a citation that &quot;U.S. GDP is higher than Canadian GDP.&quot; &#xD;&#xA; - **But**, we would be precise about what we mean by income inequality (e.g. &quot;... as measured by the Gini coefficient on household income&quot;) and the region we are talking about (a certain country, state/province, global,...).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my opinion, the question fails to define what it means by income inequality, but no citation is needed to say that income inequality is rising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the comments to that question, I said that, as measured by the Gini coefficient, income inequality is rising in the United States... a very specific (and falsifiable) answer.  You asked for proof, and I think that reveals an extreme view of the sorts of evidence that are required.  That answer was a fact, and is very easily looked up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**In my opinion, we can not make a blanket requirement for proof of every trend.** One needs to use discretion and professional experience to decide when citation is necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not making this a personal argument, but another case-in-point is in your answer to another question ([Is physical gold inflation-proof?](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/187/is-physical-gold-inflation-proof/247#247)), you state &quot;If you hold gold over time it will probably resist inflation. &quot;  Why you think that sort of statement doesn't require citation, but that well-known trends do need to be cited is rather beyond my comprehension.  Does the addition of the word &quot;probably&quot; excuse the need for citation?  But, I agree that your statement does not require citation, exactly because it is fairly well-known that gold is an inflation hedge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, if you are right that this site is &quot;by professionals for professionals&quot;, then I'd argue that we should rely on personal judgement to decide what needs to be cited and avoid any sort of rule that everything must be cited.

This would include questions of how does X fit with Y or What do economists say about Z.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Since these are graduate level questions all answers should be able to be referenced.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These policies should help to mostly eliminate less useful and political questions about the economy.

Lots of terrific research in a variety of fields takes place outside of the model of peer-reviewed, hard-copy journals.  If this is a result of a desire to keep so-called cranks away, the collective economic expertise of this site should be able to downvote and explain why their ideas lack merit (and if the experts can't explain this, then maybe the ideas do have merit and deserve inclusion).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't see why questions about web-based currency or video game currency would be off-topic.  People buy real things in the real world with web-based currencies everyday, so those are real economies that happen to involve different assumptions from traditional currency.  As for video game economies, I suspect the incentives are a bit different in that arena from traditional economies.  That doesn't mean they warrant exclusion; just be clear about what assumptions are necessary and what are the implications of those assumptions.  A lot can be learned by studying the effects of a change in assumptions (in the world of mathematics, this is what drove a lot of advances in geometry and abstract algebra in the last 200 years).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not directly related to economics, I feel the need to point out that epidemiologists have written (in [an actual paper!][1]) about the spread of infectious disease in World of Warcraft.

And questions should show some research effort, and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be useful to others as well as the OP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further, there have been a number of undergraduate-level questions.  These questions haven't gotten any comments about not being at the right &quot;level&quot; and all have net positive up-votes from the community.  The revealed preference seems to be to accept these questions even though the site is still officially for grad/professional questions.  A few examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [What is a public good?](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/364/what-is-a-public-good)&#xD;&#xA; - [How to extract a set of values from a specific range of indexes](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/353/how-to-extract-a-set-of-values-from-a-specific-range-of-indexes)&#xD;&#xA; - [Choosing a profit-maximizing output given two markets](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/340/choosing-a-profit-maximizing-output-given-two-markets)&#xD;&#xA; - [Why would monopolist never produce at the inelastic part of the demand curve?](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/337/why-would-monopolist-never-produce-at-the-inelastic-part-of-the-demand-curve)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The acceptance of these questions stands in stark contrast to what was deemed acceptable during the private beta, and the official mandate of the site as laid out in the Area 51 proposal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The audience of the site affects a variety of other factors.  For example, I think the question to: [How should we respond to Normative questions?](http://meta.economics.stackexchange.com/questions/92/how-should-we-respond-to-normative-questions) hinges largely on the audience of the site (see my answer to that question).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I am not familiar with the procedures, but can someone please guide us towards resolving this question?**  I think it is very important that an unambiguous standard be set, whatever that standard may be.&#xD;&#xA;" />

In answering that question we need to recognise that economics will always be a &quot;social&quot; subject.  A person may not be a graduate or professional to notice something, describe it and ask - all without knowing what the technical terms are or even that it was resolved 200 years ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, we do need to maintain a particular standard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My approach, rightly or wrongly, is based on 10 years of teaching non-economics undergraduate students economics (a bit like Freakonomics, really).  I found that the best way to invite people with strongly-held normative or uninformed views towards a positive answer they could understand and accept was a polite and respectful assistance towards rephrasing their question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't believe that flaming each other when these sorts of questions are asked will set the appropriate tone or create a sufficiently robust site that can survive for any length of time.

So, what's inappropriate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Any question which would result in the correct Wikipedia entry turning up in the first result of a Google search would be a good one to delete (or monitor, if they really do turn up frequently we may have to leave it there);&#xD;&#xA; - Any open-ended or unanswerable question which cannot be rephrased to be closed or positive (and that may not be immediately obvious from the question);&#xD;&#xA; - Specific questions about trading stocks or shares which would be better suited to Personal Finance and the Quant Stackexchanges;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Undergraduate, or lay, questions tend to fall into the easy or normative buckets.  In which case there is already a single-point answer (Wikipedia) or they need to be rephrased.  Perhaps, on rephrasing, we could create a small section header which says: **Normative versions of this Positive Question**.... and then details all the permutations which we observe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few ideas.

I'm drawing from my observations as a user on other SE sites, particularly those with a lot of **prose** rather than code or formula-heavy content:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Standard **&quot;protocol&quot;** on SE sites is to mention the existence of a similar question or answer by URL in the question comments. That won't be misunderstood as *possible duplicate* if it is prefaced with a courteous, **&quot;See this too, it might be helpful&quot;**. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also: Sometimes users don't feel energetic or have the time to write a decent answer. Yet they know that some or all of a few other question comments or answers would fully address a new question. That's okay! It takes time to write a decent answer, even if aggregating pieces of existing content. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is much better to leave comments than enter a very poor quality answer. I often see one, occasionally see two SE URLs included in the same comment following a question. That is **so** preferable to  a big concatenated copy-paste answer, even **with** attribution. There's a beta site I visit with some of the latter going on. It isn't appealing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other reason to leave the URLs in the comments is that if someone else comes along who has the time and energy, they can use that as a starting point for a good answer." />

However, I'm finding it a bit difficult for a few reasons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. There aren't many downvotes on questions.  When the community has upvoted a question such that it has net upvotes, I'm hesitant to go against the community consensus and close it.  All but one of the questions with &lt; -1 net votes have been closed so far.  For example, the three questions you listed all have net upvotes, and one had no downvotes at all.  Are the quant and math communities more likely to downvote poor questions?&#xD;&#xA; 2. There aren't many suggested edits.  Right now, there are no suggested edits in the queue.  We need to get the entire community involved in editing questions. There seems to be a preference for commenting on the question instead of editing it directly (I'm guilty here too).&#xD;&#xA; 3. My understanding is that in SE poor *answers* are usually handled by downvoting them and that only **extremely** poor answers are deleted.  I've deleted a couple of obvious ones. Please correct me if I'm wrong.&#xD;&#xA; 4. There is still some debate about the proper level of questions (e.g. whether the grad/professional hurdle still applies).  As I understand it, the latest conclusion was to let the community set the standard dynamically with down/close votes.  There is a [meta post on this topic](http://meta.economics.stackexchange.com/questions/95/is-the-economics-stackexchange-still-for-grad-and-professional-qa-only), and **it would be great to have more opinions there** as I don't think the matter is quite settled yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any opinion or advice would be appreciated!" />

Those of us who have (or still will) put in the time and effort to become trusted members and moderators will have undue influence (through edits and the ability to vote to close).  In that respect, we have a more difficult role as we need to decide.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The questions you're asking (and that I'm taking a hit for asking, re normative) are essential to establishing what it is we would like the site to be.  In answering that question we need to recognise that economics will always be a &quot;social&quot; subject.  A person may not be a graduate or professional to notice something, describe it and ask - all without knowing what the technical terms are or even that it was resolved 200 years ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, we do need to maintain a particular standard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My approach, rightly or wrongly, is based on 10 years of teaching non-economics undergraduate students economics (a bit like Freakonomics, really).  I found that the best way to invite people with strongly-held normative or uninformed views towards a positive answer they could understand and accept was a polite and respectful assistance towards rephrasing their question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't believe that flaming each other when these sorts of questions are asked will set the appropriate tone or create a sufficiently robust site that can survive for any length of time.  It will become unpleasant for some and a very steep learning curve for others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, an answer (of sorts): those of us who take this seriously should consider rephrasing questions that we define as inappropriate and justifying quite clearly (and positively) why such a change was made.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Inappropriate gets back to your question.  So, what's inappropriate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Any question which would result in the correct Wikipedia entry turning up in the first result of a Google search would be a good one to delete (or monitor, if they really do turn up frequently we may have to leave it there);&#xD;&#xA; - Any open-ended or unanswerable question which cannot be rephrased to be closed or positive (and that may not be immediately obvious from the question);&#xD;&#xA; - Specific questions about trading stocks or shares which would be better suited to Personal Finance and the Quant Stackexchanges;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Undergraduate, or lay, questions tend to fall into the easy or normative buckets.  In which case there is already a single-point answer (Wikipedia) or they need to be rephrased.  Perhaps, on rephrasing, we could create a small section header which says: **Normative versions of this Positive Question**.... and then details all the permutations which we observe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few ideas.  Would be good to discuss answers now before market forces take it in a direction we cannot predict (but which is nevertheless &quot;correct&quot;) ;p&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;UPDATED:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Responding to @QuantGuy, overcoming the &quot;revealed preferences&quot; is something we can now do (as moderators) but we do suffer from a &quot;founder effect&quot; - a small body of people some of whom may have particular biases - I think we should only close a question if thorough editing can't convert it into a meaningful question." />

The paper is a curiosity indeed, and is worth reading if only for the attention it received when originally published.  Further, while it seems quite a bit off, it did appear in the JPE [(2002 v10 n1)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/324390), which by itself makes the paper relevant (but not necessarily right of course).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Paper taken seriously**: E&amp;K's paper has been taken seriously in serious journals, for example by Arunachalam and Shah (AER 2008) who call it a &quot;seminal paper.&quot;  Their main objection is to E&amp;K's simplifying assumption that a prostitute cannot later marry, a claim for which they find no empirical evidence.

I went through the paper in some detail, trying to highlight some of the assumptions they made.  I think I made it pretty clear that some of the assumptions are unrealistic (and even offensive).  But if we are to exclude literature with unrealistic assumptions then that will very much limit the set of economics papers we can use on this site.  The usual process is to think about a model in the context of its assumptions--that is, just what insights we can take from a model are limited by the assumptions.  The usual criterion is not whether the model is right, but whether any useful insights can be gained from it.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I don't think the question itself is offensive as edited.  I also think the question is odd, but as (re)written it is clearly an economics question (and in scope).  But let me know if you disagree. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**(In?)famous paper**:  The answer was obvious as I recalled having the referenced paper (Edlund and Korn) in my files (he was originally asking if there was any research on this topic).   The paper is a curiosity indeed, and is worth reading if only for the attention it received when originally published.  Further, while it seems quite a bit off, it did appear in the JPE [(2002 v10 n1)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/324390), which by itself makes the paper relevant (but not necessarily right of course).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Paper taken seriously**: E&amp;K's paper has been taken seriously in serious journals, for example by Arunachalam and Shah (AER 2008) who call it a &quot;seminal paper.&quot;  Their main objection is to E&amp;K's simplifying assumption that a prostitute cannot later marry, a claim for which they find no empirical evidence.  They assert an &quot;alternative hypothesis&quot; to explain sex workers' relatively high wages: that the profession exposes its workers to a higher risk (they focus on STDs).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Criteria for Judging the Worth of a Model**: Instead of just summarizing the results. I went through the paper in some detail, trying to highlight some of the assumptions they made.  I think I made it pretty clear that some of the assumptions are unrealistic (and even offensive).  But if we are to exclude literature with unrealistic assumptions then that will very much limit the set of economics papers we can use on this site.  The usual process is to think about a model in the context of its assumptions--that is, just what insights we can take from a model are limited by the assumptions.  The usual criterion is not whether the model is right, but whether any useful insights can be gained from it.&#xD;&#xA;" />
